gnome-software is a Linux command that launches the GNOME Software application. GNOME Software is a graphical user interface for installing and managing software packages and applications on Linux systems.

When you run the command "gnome-software" on a terminal or a command prompt, the GNOME Software application will open. Once the application is open, you can browse through software categories, search for specific applications, view application details, and install or remove software packages.

The GNOME Software interface includes search and filter options, ratings and reviews, and the ability to manage software sources and updates. This tool is particularly useful for Linux users who prefer a GUI interface over the command line to manage software on their systems. It offers an easy and intuitive way to browse and install software packages on Linux.
