The `abbr` command in HTML stands for "abbreviation". It is used to define an abbreviation or acronym for a longer term that appears frequently in the document. This can help to make the document more easily understood by providing a clear and concise definition for the term.

The `abbr` command is an inline element that is used within a block of text. It has two required attributes: `title` and `abbr`. The `title` attribute specifies the full term that the abbreviation represents, while the `abbr` attribute specifies the abbreviation itself.

Here's an example of how the `abbr` command can be used in HTML:

```html
<p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> is a standards organization that develops specifications for the web.</p>
```

In this example, the text "W3C" is the abbreviation, and the full term it represents is "World Wide Web Consortium". When a user hovers over the "W3C" text, they will see a tooltip that displays the full term.

Overall, the `abbr` command is a useful tool for making HTML documents more readable and accessible, especially when dealing with technical terms or acronyms.
