Netselect-apt is a command-line tool used to find the fastest Debian archive mirror available. It works by downloading package lists from several mirrors, measuring the amount of time it takes to complete this task, and then selecting the mirrors with the lowest download times. These mirrors are then ranked according to speed and can be used to update and install packages on a Debian system.

Here's an example command:

```
$ sudo netselect-apt -s -n -v -t 10 -a amd64 stretch
```

- `sudo`: The `netselect-apt` command needs to run with root privileges to perform certain operations like writing to certain directories.

- `netselect-apt`: The name of the command we're executing.

- `-s`: Enables strict checking of SSL certificates. This option ensures that the selected mirrors are secure.

- `-n`: Enables the the use of non-free packages.

- `-v`: Enables verbose output. This option will display more information on the screen regarding the progress of the command.

- `-t 10`: Specifies the number of seconds to wait for a response from the mirrors. In this example, we're setting the timeout to 10 seconds.

- `-a amd64`: Specifies the architecture of the system we're running on. In this example, we're using an amd64 architecture.

- `stretch`: Specifies the name of the Debian release we're using. In this example, we're using Stretch.

Once executed, the command will output a list of the fastest mirrors ranked based on their response times. The output will look similar to this:

```
149 mirrors considered.
  75 ftp.ubuntu-tw.org/debian/
  78 ftp.it.debian.org/debian/
  82 ftp.debian.org/debian/
  82 ftp.mirrorservice.org/debian/
  84 mirrors.kernel.org/debian/
  84 mirror.vutbr.cz/debian/
  86 fr.archive.ubuntu.com/debian/
  87 ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/debian/
  88 mirror.us.leaseweb.net/debian/
  89 ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/debian/
```

Once you've selected a mirror, you can edit your `sources.list` file to use this mirror URL for your Debian packages. This ensures that you download packages from a faster and more reliable mirror.

> Create a `sources.list` file for a Debian mirror with the lowest latency.
> More information: <https://manpages.debian.org/latest/netselect-apt/netselect-apt.html>.

- Create `sources.list` using the lowest latency server:

`sudo netselect-apt`

- Specify Debian branch, stable is used by default:

`sudo netselect-apt {{testing}}`

- Include non-free section:

`sudo netselect-apt --non-free`

- Specify a country for the mirror list lookup:

`sudo netselect-apt -c {{India}}`
