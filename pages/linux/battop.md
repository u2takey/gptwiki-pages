As an AI language model, I do not have access to install or execute commands on a computer. However, I can explain what the `battop` command does.

`battop` is a command available on Linux systems that displays real-time battery usage information. When executed, it opens a terminal window that shows a continuous update of the current battery level, charging status, and estimated time remaining until the battery is fully charged or drained. It also displays other technical information about the battery, such as its manufacturer, serial number, and design capacity.

This command is particularly useful for laptop users who want to monitor their battery usage, especially when running power-intensive applications that drain the battery quickly. Additionally, it can help users diagnose potential battery issues, such as a battery that drains too quickly or fails to fully charge.
