HLint is a command-line tool that analyzes and suggests improvements for Haskell source code. It identifies common programming errors and inefficiencies, and offers suggestions to improve the code. The HLint tool analyzes the source files and provides a list of potential errors or warnings, along with suggested fixes for them. 

The command "hlint" is used to run the HLint tool on Haskell source code files. When you run this command, it analyzes the specified files and provides you with a list of suggestions to improve your code. It also provides information on how to use the tool and how to interpret the output.

Using the HLint tool can greatly improve the quality of your Haskell code, making it easier to maintain and more efficient. It can also help you catch potential errors and inconsistencies, which will save you time when debugging your code.

- Display suggestions for a given file:

`hlint {{path/to/file}} options`

- Check all Haskell files and generate a report:

`hlint {{path/to/directory}} --report`

- Automatically apply most suggestions:

`hlint {{path/to/file}} --refactor`

- Display additional options:

`hlint {{path/to/file}} --refactor-options`

- Generate a settings file ignoring all outstanding hints:

`hlint {{path/to/file}} --default > {{.hlint.yaml}}`
