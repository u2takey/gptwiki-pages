The 'locate' command in Linux is a command-line tool that is used to search for files or directories on the system. The command will find all files and directories that match the given search criteria recursively from the root directory. The 'locate' command works by searching a database of filenames that is updated nightly by the 'updatedb' command. 

The syntax for using the 'locate' command is simple: 

```
locate [option] pattern
```

Here, 'option' refers to any additional options that you want to use with the 'locate' command. There are a few commonly used options like '-i' (ignore case), '-r' (regular expression search), and '-c' (display number of files found). 

The 'pattern' argument is the search term that you want to use to find files or directories. This can be a partial or full name of the file or directory. For example, to find all files containing the word 'linux', the command would be: 

```
locate linux
```

When you run the 'locate' command, it will display a list of all files and directories that match your search criteria. The output will show you the full path of each file or directory, enabling you to quickly locate and access them.

Note that the 'locate' command cannot search for recently created files, as it relies on the updated database. Also, the output of the 'locate' command may include system files that the user may not have permissions to access.

- Look for pattern in the database. Note: the database is recomputed periodically (usually weekly or daily):

`locate {{pattern}}`

- Look for a file by its exact filename (a pattern containing no globbing characters is interpreted as `*pattern*`):

`locate */{{filename}}`

- Recompute the database. You need to do it if you want to find recently added files:

`sudo updatedb`
