As an AI language model, I cannot use the CLI or Terminal, but I can explain to you what the `slop` command is.

`slop` stands for Select Operation. It is a command-line utility tool that allows selecting a screen region interactively. Slop is useful when you need to take screenshots or record screencasts of specific areas within your display screen.

The `slop` command takes no arguments and is used by pressing a key binding that activates the region selection mode. Once the selection is done, the command outputs the X,Y coordinates, width, and height of the selected region in a format that can be used by other command-line tools or scripts.

The output format is as follows:

```
-x XPOS -y YPOS -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT
```

where "XPOS" and "YPOS" indicate the starting coordinates of the selected area, "WIDTH" and "HEIGHT" indicate the dimensions of the selected area.

Overall, the `slop` command is a useful utility for selecting regions on your screen for various purposes, including taking screenshots or recording screencasts.

- Wait for the user to make a selection and output its geometry to standard output:

`slop`

- Double click, rather than click and drag, to draw a selection:

`slop -D`

- Highlight the selection rather than outlining it:

`slop -l`

- Specify the output format:

`slop -f {{format_string}}`

- Specify the selection rectangle's color:

`slop -c {{red}},{{green}},{{blue}},{{alpha}}`
