# cc 
## chatgpt 
cc is a commonly used command in Unix and Linux-like operating systems, short for "C compiler". It is used to compile C language source code files into executable binary files that can be run on the system.

The basic syntax of the cc command is:

cc [options] [source files] [-o output file]

Here, "options" refers to any command-line flags or options that are passed to the compiler, "source files" are the C language source code files that need to be compiled, and "-o output file" specifies the name of the output file that will be generated after compilation.

Some common options that can be passed to the cc command include:

- -g: include debugging symbols in the compiled binary for debugging purposes
- -Wall: enable all warning messages during compilation
- -c: compile the source files and generate object files instead of executable files
- -I: specify the directory where header files are located
- -L: specify the directory where library files are located

After compiling the source code, the cc command will create an executable binary file that can be run on the system. By default, the file will be named "a.out", but the "-o" option can be used to specify a custom name for the output file.
