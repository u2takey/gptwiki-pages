The "goaccess" command is a tool for analyzing web server logs and generating user-friendly reports in real-time or from log files. It can work with a variety of log formats including Apache, Nginx, and CloudFront CDN logs.

Running the "goaccess" command typically involves specifying the location of the log file (or a set of log files) and any desired configuration options. For example, the command might look like:

```
goaccess /var/log/nginx/access.log --log-format=COMBINED
```

This would analyze the Nginx access logs at "/var/log/nginx/access.log" using the default "combined" log format. The tool would then generate a report showing metrics such as the number of unique visitors, page views, and HTTP response codes.

GoAccess provides real-time metrics through the dashboard in your command line interface which can be accessed by simply typing 'goaccess [options]'. The tool also allows for advanced customization and filtering, which can make it a powerful tool for web server administrators and developers.

- Analyze one or more log files in interactive mode:

`goaccess {{path/to/logfile1 path/to/file2 ...}}`

- Use a specific log-format (or pre-defined formats like "combined"):

`goaccess {{path/to/logfile}} --log-format={{format}}`

- Analyze a log from `stdin`:

`tail -f {{path/to/logfile}} | goaccess -`

- Analyze a log and write it to an HTML file in real-time:

`goaccess {{path/to/logfile}} --output {{path/to/file.html}} --real-time-html`
