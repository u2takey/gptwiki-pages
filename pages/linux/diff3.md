The `diff3` command is a command-line utility used to compare and merge changes between three versions of a file. It is mainly useful for software development where multiple developers work on the same codebase and require merging the changes made by all of them.

The syntax of the `diff3` command is as follows:

```
diff3 [OPTIONS] OLD MINE YOURS
```

where `OLD` is the original file, `MINE` is the first modified version of the file, and `YOURS` is the second modified version of the file.

The `diff3` command compares the changes in the two modified versions against the original version and generates a merged output that shows the differences between the two modified files. By default, the merged output is written to the standard output.  

Some of the commonly used `diff3` command options are:

- `-m`, which merges the changes to a third file instead of outputting it to the standard output.
- `-v`, which prints only the differences between the three files without merging them.
- `-E`, which treats tab characters as spaces.

Overall, `diff3` is a powerful command that can help developers quickly identify and merge differences between multiple code versions.

- Show all changes, outlining conflicts:

`diff3 --show-all {{file1}} {{file2}} {{file3}}`
