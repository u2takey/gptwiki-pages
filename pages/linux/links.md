The `links` command is a text-based web browser used in Linux and Unix-based operating systems. It allows a user to browse websites in a terminal without requiring a graphical interface.

When the user types "links" in the command line, the browser interface opens, displaying options such as opening a new tab, opening a URL, and searching for text within a web page. Users can navigate websites using keyboard controls, similar to those used in traditional web browsers.

The `links` command can be useful for accessing web pages on servers that do not have a graphical user interface, low-powered devices such as Raspberry pi, or for those who prefer command-line interfaces over graphical user interfaces. 

Overall, `links` is a useful command for those who need to access web pages without a graphical interface.
