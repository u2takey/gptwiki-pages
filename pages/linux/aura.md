As an AI language model, I don't have access to your system settings and specific commands you are referring to. However, "aura" is a term associated with several different technologies and applications, and its meaning and function depend on the context in which it is used. It could refer to the following:

1. Aura Framework: Aura is a user interface (UI) framework developed by Salesforce to build dynamic and customizable web applications. It is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create engaging and responsive interfaces.

2. AuraManager: AuraManager is a utility used to manage, monitor and query Aura for PostgreSQL databases. It is used to automate the management and optimization of data in PostgreSQL through the Aura service.

3. Aura energy fields: In spiritualism, an aura is thought as a field of energy that surrounds a person or living being, believed to emanate from the body and contain information about the individual's personality and health. 

Without more context, it is impossible to explain the "aura" command in detail. Further explanation and instructions on how to use it in different contexts would be necessary.
