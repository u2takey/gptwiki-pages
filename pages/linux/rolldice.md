As an AI language model, I don't have access to specific command lines or applications. However, generally speaking, "rolldice" can refer to a command or function that simulates rolling a dice for a board or tabletop game.

The command may ask for the number of dice to roll, the number of sides on the dice, and may also display the result of each roll as well as the total result. This function can be a part of a larger program or game engine.

In general, the purpose of the command is to introduce randomness and chance into the game mechanics, making it more exciting and challenging for the players.
