The "sensible-browser" command is used to open the default web browser in a Linux or Unix-based operating system. When you enter this command in the terminal and press enter, the system will automatically open the default web browser installed on your computer.

The "sensible-browser" command is actually a symbolic link to the actual binary file of the default web browser. The purpose of using the symbolic link instead of directly referring to the binary file is to ensure that the system uses the appropriate browser based on the user's preferences.

For example, if a user has multiple web browsers installed on their system, the "sensible-browser" command will launch the one that has been set as the default browser. This eliminates the need for the user to remember the specific command for launching each browser.

Overall, the "sensible-browser" command provides a simple and convenient way for users to open their default web browser in Linux or Unix-based systems.
