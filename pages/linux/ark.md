As an AI language model, I can't access your operating system unless you specify it. But below is the explanation of the ark command in general:

The 'ark' command is a file archiving tool mostly used in the Linux operating system. It is similar to other archiving and compression tools like tar and zip but has its own peculiarities. With the 'ark' command, you can create archives in different formats like tar, zip, jar, rar, 7z, and more. You can also work on existing archives, and perform operations like extracting, adding, deleting or even viewing files within the archives.

To use the 'ark' command, one may simply open the terminal in most Linux distros and type 'ark' followed by the required operation and options. For instance, 'ark -c archive.zip file1 file2' means to create an archive in zip format with two files named file1 and file2. Other options like 'ark -t archive.zip' may show you the files inside an archive.

Additionally, 'ark' GUI is available which provides a user-friendly interface for the command-line tool. This makes it easier to create, edit or view archives without typing commands in the terminal.
