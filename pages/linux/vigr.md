The command "vigr" is used in Linux systems and refers to the "Edit the password/group files" command. This command allows users to modify the user and group information stored in the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files respectively.

When the "vigr" command is executed, it opens the /etc/group file in an editor such as vi or nano, allowing the user to modify the groups and users listed in the file. The modifications made through vigr will typically include adding or removing users from a group or changing a user's primary group.

It is important to note that editing these important system files should only be done with caution and by users with appropriate privileges. Any changes made through vigr will have an immediate effect on the system, so it is recommended to take a backup of the original files before making any modifications.
