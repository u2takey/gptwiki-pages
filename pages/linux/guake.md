"Guake" is a command that launches the Guake terminal application on Linux based systems. 

Guake is a drop-down terminal emulator for GNOME-based desktops which provides easy access to the terminal at any time, simply by pressing a hotkey. When the hotkey is pressed, Guake slides down from the top of the screen, providing quick access to the terminal without taking up desktop space.

When the command "guake" is executed, it launches the Guake terminal application from the command line. Once the application is running, you can press the hotkey (by default F12) to open or close the terminal window.

Overall, the "guake" command is a useful tool for accessing the terminal quickly and efficiently, especially for users who work heavily with the command line in their daily tasks.
