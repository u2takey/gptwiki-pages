`kwrite` is a command-line text editor for Linux systems. It is part of the KDE desktop environment and is designed to provide a user-friendly, feature-rich editing experience.

When you enter the `kwrite` command in the terminal, it will launch the KWrite editor with an empty document. From there, you can create, edit, and save text files.

KWrite supports syntax highlighting, so it will automatically color-code different programming languages or markup languages to help you identify different elements of your code. It also has a wide range of customization options, including the ability to change the font size and color scheme.

In addition to basic text editing features, KWrite also includes advanced functionality such as code folding, spell checking, and support for search/replace with regular expressions.

Overall, if you're looking for a powerful, user-friendly text editor for Linux, `kwrite` is a great choice.
