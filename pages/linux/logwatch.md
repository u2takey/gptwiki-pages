# logwatch 
## chatgpt 
Logwatch is a command-line tool that scans through system log files and generates an easy-to-read summary of events and statistics. It can generate reports for various system logs such as mail, ssh, Apache, and others.

The logwatch command can be executed with various options to customize the generated report, such as the time range of the logs to be examined, the log file location, and the email address to send the report to. 

Here is an example of the syntax:

```
logwatch --range "yesterday" --log-file /var/log/messages --mailto user@example.com
```

In this example, the logwatch command is scanning the /var/log/messages log file for entries from yesterday and sending the report to the user@example.com email address.

The report generated by logwatch includes a summary of each logged event, including its severity, time, and source. It also includes statistics such as the number of successful and failed login attempts, incoming and outgoing emails, and any other relevant data from the log files.

Overall, logwatch is a powerful tool that can help system administrators monitor their system activities, diagnose problems, and improve system security by identifying suspicious activities in the logs.

- Analyze logs for a range of dates at a certain level of detail:

`logwatch --range {{yesterday|today|all|help}} --detail {{low|medium|others}}'`

- Restrict report to only include information for a selected service:

`logwatch --range {{all}} --service {{apache|pam_unix|etc}}`
