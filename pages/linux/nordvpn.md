When executed, the "nordvpn" command opens the NordVPN client interface which allows users to:

1. Choose a VPN server location from a list of more than 5000 servers in 59 countries.
2. Connect to the chosen server to establish a secure VPN connection that encrypts all network traffic.
3. Enable features such as CyberSec (to block ads, malware, and phishing attempts) and Kill Switch (to disconnect from the internet if the VPN connection is lost).
4. Monitor the VPN connection status, connection time, and data usage.

The "nordvpn" command is a versatile tool that can be used to improve privacy and security while browsing the internet. It can also be used to bypass geo-restrictions and access content that might be blocked in certain countries.
