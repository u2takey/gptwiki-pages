As an AI language model, I do not have any context or knowledge about which specific command or tool you are referring to. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed explanation of any specific command or tool called "tomb". 

However, there is a command-line tool named "tomb" in Linux that allows users to create encrypted containers for their sensitive data. These encrypted containers are known as "tomb". Using the tomb command, users can create a new tomb, open an existing tomb, or remove an existing tomb. This tool is typically used to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access or theft. 

The tomb command is similar to tools like EncFS, TrueCrypt, and LUKS that are used for file and disk encryption. To use this tool, users need to have some knowledge of encryption and basic command-line skills.

- Create a new tomb with an initial size of 100 MB:

`tomb dig -s {{100}} {{encrypted_directory.tomb}}`

- Create a new key file that can be used to lock a tomb; user will be prompted for a password for the key:

`tomb forge {{encrypted_directory.tomb.key}}`

- Forcefully create a new key, even if the tomb isn't allowing key forging (due to swap):

`tomb forge {{encrypted_directory.tomb.key}} -f`

- Initialize and lock an empty tomb using a key made with `forge`:

`tomb lock {{encrypted_directory.tomb}} -k {{encrypted_directory.tomb.key}}`

- Mount a tomb (by default in `/media`) using its key, making it usable as a regular filesystem directory:

`tomb open {{encrypted_directory.tomb}} -k {{encrypted_directory.tomb.key}}`

- Close a tomb (fails if the tomb is being used by a process):

`tomb close {{encrypted_directory.tomb}}`

- Forcefully close all open tombs, killing any applications using them:

`tomb slam all`

- List all open tombs:

`tomb list`
