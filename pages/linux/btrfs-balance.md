# btrfs balance 
## chatgpt 
The "btrfs balance" command is used in the Btrfs file system to balance the data across multiple devices or sub-volumes. The purpose of this command is to distribute the file system data more evenly across different storage devices, preventing the creation of hotspots or bottlenecks.

When the "btrfs balance" command is executed, it scans the file system for imbalances in data distribution and redistributes the data accordingly. Depending on the specified options and parameters, the "btrfs balance" command can perform various types of balancing operations, such as balance to specific data or metadata profile, or balance based on a specific range of chunks.

The benefits of using "btrfs balance" command include improved performance, better space utilization, and prevention of data loss or data access issues. By redistributing the data, the file system can avoid overloading certain disks or sub-volumes, thus improving overall performance. Additionally, more even data distribution can minimize the risk of data loss or data access issues, as multiple copies of the data will be more resilient to disk failures or other errors.

To use the "btrfs balance" command, it is recommended to first perform a backup of the file system, as the process of balancing data can take a significant amount of time and may lead to data loss if unexpected errors occur. The command can be executed with different options and parameters, depending on the desired balancing strategy and the current state of the file system. It is also recommended to review the Btrfs documentation and guides for more detailed instructions and best practices on using the "btrfs balance" command.

> More information: <https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs-balance.html>.

- Show the status of a running or paused balance operation:

`sudo btrfs balance status {{path/to/btrfs_filesystem}}`

- Balance all block groups (slow; rewrites all blocks in filesystem):

`sudo btrfs balance start {{path/to/btrfs_filesystem}}`

- Balance data block groups which are less than 15% utilized, running the operation in the background:

`sudo btrfs balance start --bg -dusage={{15}} {{path/to/btrfs_filesystem}}`

- Balance a max of 10 metadata chunks with less than 20% utilization and at least 1 chunk on a given device `devid` (see `btrfs filesystem show`):

`sudo btrfs balance start -musage={{20}},limit={{10}},devid={{devid}} {{path/to/btrfs_filesystem}}`

- Convert data blocks to the raid6 and metadata to raid1c3 (see mkfs.btrfs(8) for profiles):

`sudo btrfs balance start -dconvert={{raid6}} -mconvert={{raid1c3}} {{path/to/btrfs_filesystem}}`

- Convert data blocks to raid1, skipping already converted chunks (e.g. after a previous cancelled conversion operation):

`sudo btrfs balance start -dconvert={{raid1}},soft {{path/to/btrfs_filesystem}}`

- Cancel, pause, or resume a running or paused balance operation:

`sudo btrfs balance {{cancel|pause|resume}} {{path/to/btrfs_filesystem}}`
