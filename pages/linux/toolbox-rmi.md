# toolbox rmi 
## chatgpt 
The `toolbox rmi` command is used to remove one or more Docker images from the local machine's image registry. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the command:

* `toolbox` - This is the Docker Toolbox command line tool that provides a way to use Docker on non-Linux operating systems, such as macOS or Windows.
* `rmi` - This is a subcommand of Toolbox that stands for "remove image".
* `{IMAGE_NAME}` - This is the name or ID of the Docker image that you want to remove. You can specify one or more images separated by spaces. 

For example, to remove a single image named "my-image", you would use the following command:

```
$ toolbox rmi my-image
```

If you wanted to remove multiple images named "my-image" and "my-other-image", you could use the following command:

```
$ toolbox rmi my-image my-other-image
```

Please note that once an image is removed, you will not be able to run any containers based on that image unless you pull it again or have a cached version. Additionally, any other images or containers that depend on the removed images will also be affected. So, make sure to use the `rmi` command with caution.
