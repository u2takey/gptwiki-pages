The command "checkupdates-aur" is a type of command used in Linux systems that checks for updates available in the Arch User Repository (AUR) on Arch Linux. 

The Arch User Repository is a community-driven repository of user-contributed packages for Arch Linux, and it allows the users to download and install the packages using package managers like Pacman, Yaourt or Packer.

The command "checkupdates-aur" is used to check the AUR repository for the new updates available for your installed packages on your system. It fetches the package lists from AUR and compares them with the installed packages to determine which packages can be updated.

This command is helpful for Arch Linux users who have installed software through the AUR, as it allows them to stay up-to-date with the latest software patches and security fixes, and ensures that their system runs smoothly and support the latest features.
