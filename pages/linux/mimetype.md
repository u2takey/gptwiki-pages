The "mimetype" command is a tool in Linux and Unix-like operating systems that is used to determine the MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) of a given file or input. When run, the command prints the MIME type of the file to the standard output, typically a string describing the format of the file.

The "mimetype" command works by using a database of known file types and their corresponding MIME types. This database is usually located in the /etc/mime.types file on Unix-like systems. When the command is run, it looks up the file extension of the given file, matches it with the database, and returns the corresponding MIME type.

The command can be used in various scenarios, such as when building web applications or scripts that need to determine the file type of input files. It can also be used for debugging purposes or to verify the correctness of file extensions and MIME types in the /etc/mime.types file.

To use the command, simply type "mimetype" followed by the name of the file or input to be analyzed. The output will be the corresponding MIME type for that file. For example, running "mimetype myfile.png" will return "image/png" as the MIME type for a PNG image file.

- Display a description of the MIME type:

`mimetype --describe {{path/to/file}}`

- Determine the MIME type of `stdin` (does not check a filename):

`{{some_command}} | mimetype --stdin`

- Display debug information about how the MIME type was determined:

`mimetype --debug {{path/to/file}}`

- Display all the possible MIME types of a given file in confidence order:

`mimetype --all {{path/to/file}}`

- Explicitly specify the 2-letter language code of the output:
