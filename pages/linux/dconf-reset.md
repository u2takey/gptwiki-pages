# dconf reset

The "dconf reset" command is used to reset the settings stored in the dconf database to their default values. The dconf database is a configuration system used in some Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora. It stores settings for many system and application configurations, and resetting it can often be a useful way to restore system settings to their original state.

When you enter the "dconf reset" command in a terminal window, the dconf database will be erased and replaced with the default settings for your system. This will reset all system settings, which includes everything from desktop wallpaper, custom fonts and color schemes, to system and application settings and preferences that you may have customized before.

Note that when you use the "dconf reset" command, you'll be unable to undo any changes, as the command doesn't create any backups of the current dconf database. So it's important to be sure that you want to reset all system settings before executing the command. Additionally, the command may not work on all Linux distributions or on systems with custom configurations.
