Caja is a file manager program for the GNOME desktop environment. It provides an intuitive graphical interface for users to manage their files, folders and applications.

When the "caja" command is executed in a terminal or from the GNOME applications menu, it launches the Caja file manager window. From there, users can navigate through their file system, copy, move, delete and create files and folders, perform file operations, view file properties and permissions, open files in a text editor or viewer, and access network locations.

Caja also allows users to customize their file manager preferences such as modifying the default actions, changing the layout, and setting up custom keyboard shortcuts.

In addition to file management features, Caja provides integration with other GNOME desktop components such as the desktop background, icon themes, and window manager.

Overall, the caja command is a powerful tool for managing files and folders in the GNOME desktop environment on Linux-based operating systems.
