# debman 
## chatgpt 
Unfortunately, I cannot explain the command "debman" as it is not a standard command in Linux or any other operating system. It is possible that it is a custom command created by an individual or organization for their specific needs. Can you provide any more context or information about where or how you encountered this command?

- Read a man page for a command that is provided by a specified package name:

`debman -p {{package_name}} {{command_name}}`

- Specify a package version to download:

`debman -p {{package_name}}={{version}} {{command_name}}`

- Read a man page in a `.deb` file:

`debman -f {{path/to/filename.deb}} {{command_name}}`
