# ip route list 
## chatgpt 
The "ip route list" command is a Linux/Unix command that is used to display the kernel's routing table. Specifically, this command displays the current IPv4 routing table for a host or a network. 

Each entry in the routing table contains information about how to reach a specific network or host. The information includes the destination network or host's IP address, the netmask, the gateway or next-hop address, the interface through which the packet will be sent, and additional routing metrics.

By displaying the routing table, network administrators can verify the network connectivity and troubleshoot issues related to network routing.
