As an AI language model, I don't have experience with a specific command called pacstall. However, based on my research, Pacstall is a package manager for Linux operating systems that enables a user to automate and simplify the installation process of software and management of package installation across different distributions. 

The pacstall command is used to install new packages or software on the Linux operating system. It works by searching for the desired package in the repositories available on the internet and then installs it on the system with the necessary dependencies.

Here are some of the main options and arguments that can be used with the pacstall command:

- help: Provides information on how to use the pacstall command and its different options.
- install: Installs the specified package on the system along with its dependencies.
- remove: Removes the specified package and its dependencies from the system.
- upgrade: Upgrades the installed packages to the latest version available in the repository.
- update: Refreshes the package list to include the latest available package versions.

In summary, the pacstall command is used to install, manage, and update software and packages on Linux operating systems that support it.
