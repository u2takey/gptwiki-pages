The "rmmod" command is a Linux command used to remove a kernel module or driver from the Linux system. 

The syntax of the command is as follows:

`rmmod [module name]`

where the "module name" specifies the name of the module that needs to be removed.

When executed, the "rmmod" command unloads the module from the Linux kernel's memory, freeing up system resources and allowing other modules to be loaded in its place. 

However, it should be noted that not all modules can be removed through this command. Some modules are required for the system to run and cannot be removed without causing system instability or crashes.

Additionally, the "rmmod" command requires root or superuser privileges to be executed, as the action of unloading a kernel module has the potential to affect system stability if done improperly. 

Hence, it is important to be cautious and understand the implications of removing a specific kernel module before executing this command.
