The "xterm" command launches a terminal emulator program that runs in the X Window System, a graphical system used by many Linux and Unix-based operating systems. 

When the "xterm" command is run, a new window opens that looks and functions like a traditional Unix terminal. Within the xterm window, users can enter commands and interact with the system using a shell of their choice (e.g. bash, zsh, etc.).

The xterm program offers a number of configurable options, such as the font used for the text, size of the window, colors, and more. These options can be controlled through command line flags or through xterm's configuration file.

Overall, the xterm command is commonly used to launch a basic terminal window in the X Window System for running command-line tasks.
