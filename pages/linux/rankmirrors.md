The `rankmirrors` command is used to rank the mirrors or repositories according to their connection speed and availability for package downloads in a particular Linux distribution. 

When running `rankmirrors`, the user is prompted to select their geographic location and the command will automatically detect the nearest mirrors based on that location. The command then tests the connection speed of each mirror and ranks them in order of fastest to slowest. 

Once the ranking is complete, the command will generate a new mirror list to replace the existing repository list. This helps to optimize package downloads based on the user's location, which can significantly improve download speed and reliability.

Overall, the `rankmirrors` command is a useful tool for Linux users who want to speed up the package installation process and ensure that they are downloading packages from the most reliable repositories available.

- Rank a mirror list:

`rankmirrors {{/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist}}`

- Output only a given number of the top ranking servers:

`rankmirrors -n {{number}} {{/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist}}`

- Be verbose when generating the mirrorlist:

`rankmirrors -v {{/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist}}`

- Test only a specific URL:

`rankmirrors --url {{url}}`

- Output only the response times instead of a full mirrorlist:

`rankmirrors --times {{/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist}}`
