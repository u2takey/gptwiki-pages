The "unix2dos" command is primarily used to convert plain text files in Unix or Linux operating systems to DOS format. The DOS format uses different line-ending characters than Unix or Linux, so this command can be helpful when transferring files between operating systems.

When executed, the "unix2dos" command reads the input file and replaces every line-ending character with the equivalent DOS line-ending characters. The converted file is then saved as a new file or it can replace the original file.

Here is the basic syntax for the "unix2dos" command:

```
unix2dos [options] inputfile outputfile
```
The "options" parameter is optional and can be used to modify the way the command behaves. Some common options include:

- "--help" or "-h": displays help information and a list of available options.
- "--version" or "-V": displays the version number of the command.

The "inputfile" parameter specifies the name of the file to be converted. The "outputfile" parameter specifies the name of the new file that will contain the converted text.

For example, if you have a file called "mytext.txt" in Unix format and you want to convert it to DOS format, you can use the following command:

```
unix2dos mytext.txt mytext_dos.txt
```
This will create a new file called "mytext_dos.txt" with the converted text.

Overall, the "unix2dos" command is a simple tool that can be useful when transferring text files between Unix/Linux and DOS systems.

- Change the line endings of a file:

`unix2dos {{filename}}`

- Create a copy with DOS-style line endings:

`unix2dos -n {{filename}} {{new_filename}}`
