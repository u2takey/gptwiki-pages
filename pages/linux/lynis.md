Lynis is a security auditing tool used for analyzing Linux and Unix operating systems. It checks for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential threats. The tool is designed to be run by the system administrator, auditor, or security professional.

When you run the "lynis" command in a terminal or shell, the tool will scan the system for known and potential security issues. The tool will generate a log file that provides a detailed audit report of the system. The report will include information on the system's configuration, security measures, user accounts, file systems, network settings, and other related information.

Lynis will analyze the system's configuration files and settings for common vulnerabilities, such as insecure permissions, outdated software, missing security patches, and open network ports. The tool will also recommend ways to mitigate the identified security issues.

Overall, lynis is a comprehensive security auditing tool that can help you ensure your system is secure and protect it against potential attacks.
