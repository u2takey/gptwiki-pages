The "lvdisplay" command in Linux is used to display information about the logical volumes (LVs) present in the system. Logical volumes are essentially partitions created at the logical volume manager (LVM) layer of the system. 

When you execute the "lvdisplay" command, it will display the details of all the logical volumes available in the system. This includes the name of the logical volume, size, allocation policy, read and write policies, and other attributes such as the UUID and the creation time. 

The output of the "lvdisplay" command also displays information about the physical volumes (PVs) used by the logical volumes. This includes the device names, size, the number of physical extents used, and more.

Overall, the lvdisplay command is used to display detailed information about the logical volumes present in the system and can be used to troubleshoot problems arising due to logical volume management.
