The "cal" command is used in Linux and Unix operating systems to display a calendar of a specific month or year. 

When the "cal" command is used without any arguments, it displays the current month's calendar. 

For example, if the command "cal" is entered into the terminal, it will show a calendar for the current month with the current date highlighted. 

If a specific year is specified as an argument after the "cal" command, it will display a calendar for the entire year. 

For example, "cal 2022" will show a calendar for the year 2022. 

The "cal" command also allows for the specification of a month and a year, using the format "cal MM YYYY". 

For example, "cal 05 2022" will show a calendar for the month of May in the year 2022. 

Overall, the "cal" command is a simple yet useful tool for displaying a calendar on Linux and Unix systems.
