As an AI language model, I do not have access to the complete context or specifications of this task or command. However, I will provide an explanation based on the general usage of the "blurlock" command. 

The "blurlock" command is used to enable a blur effect on the screen and lock the computer simultaneously. This is commonly used as a security measure to prevent unauthorized access when the user is away from their computer. When the "blurlock" command is executed, it activates the blur effect and locks the computer, requiring a password to unlock it. This helps to protect the user's data and privacy from others who may have physical access to their computer.

Additionally, some operating systems or desktop environments may have different implementations or variations of the "blurlock" command, so it is recommended to refer to the relevant documentation or user guide for the specific system being used.
