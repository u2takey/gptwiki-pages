# e2undo

The "e2undo" command is a utility command used in the Linux operating system to undo the changes made to an ext2/ext3/ext4 file system. It is used to revert the file system to a previous state by undoing any changes made in the previous operation such as moving or deleting files or directories. 

The syntax of the command is as follows:

e2undo [-v] file_system_device

where:

-v: The verbose option displays a detailed output of the process while it is running.
file_system_device: This is the device that refers to the file system on which the undo operation is being performed. 

When the e2undo command is executed, it reads the undo log of the file system and restores the original state of the file system. This command can only be used if the undo log is available for the file system. If the undo log is not present or has been deleted, the e2fsck command must be used to recover the file system instead. 

In summary, the e2undo command is an important utility command that helps in reverting any changes made to an ext2/ext3/ext4 file system. It is particularly useful when a user accidentally deletes or moves a file and needs to restore the file system to its original state.

- Display information about a specific undo file:

`e2undo -h {{path/to/undo_file}} {{/dev/sdXN}}`

- Perform a dry-run and display the candidate blocks for replaying:

`e2undo -nv {{path/to/undo_file}} {{/dev/sdXN}}`

- Perform an undo operation:

`e2undo {{path/to/undo_file}} {{/dev/sdXN}}`

- Perform an undo operation and display verbose information:

`e2undo -v {{path/to/undo_file}} {{/dev/sdXN}}`

- Write the old contents of the block to an undo file before overwriting a file system block:

`e2undo -z {{path/to/file.e2undo}} {{path/to/undo_file}} {{/dev/sdXN}}`
