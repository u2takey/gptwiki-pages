As an AI language model, I don't have access to context of the question and its related field but I will try my best to explain the duperemove command.

The duperemove command is used to find and remove duplicate files from a specified directory. When executed, the command will scan the directory and all its subdirectories and check if there are any files that have the same content. If duplicates are found, the command will prompt the user to choose which files to keep and which to delete.

The exact syntax of the duperemove command may vary depending on the operating system and the tool or script that is being used to execute it. However, the basic structure generally includes the name of the command followed by the directory path or paths that should be scanned for duplicates.

For example, on Linux systems the basic syntax of the duperemove command may look like this:

```duperemove [directory path]```

This will initiate the scanning process for the specified directory path and its subdirectories.

Some tools may have additional options such as excluding specific files, specifying criteria for determining duplicates, or automatically deleting duplicates without user input.

Overall, the duperemove command is a useful tool for identifying and removing duplicate files, which can save storage space and make file management easier.

- Search for duplicate extents in a directory and show them:

`duperemove -r {{path/to/directory}}`

- Deduplicate duplicate extents on a Btrfs or XFS (experimental) filesystem:

`duperemove -r -d {{path/to/directory}}`

- Use a hash file to store extent hashes (less memory usage and can be reused on subsequent runs):

`duperemove -r -d --hashfile={{path/to/hashfile}} {{path/to/directory}}`

- Limit I/O threads (for hashing and dedupe stage) and CPU threads (for duplicate extent finding stage):

`duperemove -r -d --hashfile={{path/to/hashfile}} --io-threads={{N}} --cpu-threads={{N}} {{path/to/directory}}`
