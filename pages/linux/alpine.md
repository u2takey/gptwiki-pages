"Alpine" is a command-line email client used for reading, sending, and managing email. It is designed for text-based interfaces and is commonly used on Unix-like operating systems. The command "alpine" launches the program and opens the user's inbox by default. From there, the user can navigate through various email folders and perform actions such as composing new emails, replying to or forwarding messages, moving or deleting emails, and searching through messages. The interface is primarily keyboard-driven and features various shortcuts to expedite workflow. Alpine supports various email protocols, including IMAP, POP3, and SMTP, and has various customization options available to the user.
