Terminator is not a command, but rather a terminal emulator that can be installed and used on various Linux distributions. It is designed to provide users with multiple terminals in a single window, allowing them to work on multiple tasks simultaneously.

Terminator provides a customizable terminal window with various features such as splitting the window horizontally or vertically. The user can also manage the terminals by renaming them, resizing them, and issuing commands to all terminals simultaneously.

To install Terminator, one may use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install terminator
```

After the installation process is complete, users can simply launch Terminator by typing 'terminator' in the terminal or by searching for it in the launcher.
