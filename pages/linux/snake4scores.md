As an AI language model, I do not have the full context to understand what the command "snake4scores" refers to. However, assuming that it refers to a command in a game or a software, it is difficult to provide a detailed explanation without further context. 

Here are some possibilities based on different interpretations of the command: 

- If "snake4scores" is a command in a classic Snake game, it might refer to accessing or displaying the player's score in 4-digit format. 
- It could also be a command in a software used by competitive snake breeders to record or compare snake scores based on certain criteria. 
- It could also be a custom command set up by a user to streamline a workflow or automate a task related to snake-related data. 

Without more information, providing a precise explanation of the command is challenging.
