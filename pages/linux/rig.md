As an AI language model, I don't have hands so I don't really have the capability to execute commands on a computer, but I can explain the command "rig" to the best of my abilities.

"rig" is a command-line tool used in computer animation and visual effects. It is mainly used to create skeletal structures for digital 3D models. The rigging process involves creating a set of bones or joint structures within a model and connecting them with controls or handles. These controls are used to move and manipulate different parts of the model, making it possible to create different poses and movements.

When using the "rig" command, there are different parameters and flags that can be added to customize the rigging process. For example, the "-b" flag is used to create a basic rig structure, the "-c" flag allows for customization of the number of joints and bones, and the "-l" flag can be used to specify which axis the rig will be aligned to.

Overall, the "rig" command is an important tool used in the 3D animation industry to create complex and realistic motion in digital models.
