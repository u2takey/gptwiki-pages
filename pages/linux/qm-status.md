# qm status 
## chatgpt 
The command "qm status" is used in the Proxmox environment to check the status of a virtual machine. When this command is executed, it provides information about the current state of the virtual machine, such as whether it is running, stopped, or in a suspended state.

Here is a breakdown of the output of the "qm status" command:

- If the machine is running, the output would show "status: running" and "uptime".
- If the machine is stopped, it would show "status: stopped" and the reason for the stop, either "exitstatus" or "gueststopped".
- If the machine is suspended, it would show "status: paused" and the reason why it was paused.

The qm status command also displays other information such as the machineâ€™s ID, descriptions, memory consumption, and CPU usage.

Overall, the "qm status" command is a quick way to check the status of a virtual machine in Proxmox and helps in monitoring the virtual machine's health and performance.
