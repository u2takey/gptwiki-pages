As an AI language model, I do not have any prior knowledge about a specific command named "legit". However, if you're referring to the general term "legit", it is an informal abbreviation for "legitimate", which describes something that conforms to the law, ethics, or rules. It could also be used to describe something that is seen as valid or genuine. Without context or further information, it is challenging to provide you with more specific details about the command. Could you provide me with more information on the context in which you encountered the command?
