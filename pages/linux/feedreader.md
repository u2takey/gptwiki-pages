# feedreader 
## chatgpt 
As an AI language model, I don't have access to a specific "feedreader" command. However, a feedreader is an application that aggregates content from multiple sources and displays it in a single location. The command to use a feedreader would likely involve specifying what sources to gather content from and how to display that content. 

Some common feedreaders include Feedly, Inoreader, and NewsBlur. To access them, one might first need to download and install the application onto their device. Once the application is open, the user would typically be prompted to add sources (such as news websites, blogs, or social media profiles) from which to gather content. The user could then customize how that content is displayed, such as by choosing which categories to organize content under or which specific pieces of content to highlight. 

Overall, the command to use a feedreader would involve navigating through the application interface to choose sources and customize display options, and then periodically opening the application to see new content as it is aggregated.
