Sorry, as an AI language model, I do not have personal experience or preferences, but I can provide the following information. 

The "htpdate" command is a network time synchronization utility specifically designed for HTTP-based time servers. It enables the machine to synchronize its clock with remote HTTP servers rather than the standard NTP protocol, which may be more accurate and reliable. 

Here are the basic syntax and description of the command:

Syntax: 

htpdate [options] URL

Description:

The htpdate command retrieves the current time from one or more web servers and adjusts the local system time accordingly. It uses standard HTTP/1.1 protocol to connect to the servers and exchange timing information. htpdate relies on accurate timestamps from HTTP response headers to measure the network latency and time offset between the client and server. Once it determines the time differences, it sets the system clock to the most accurate time obtained.

Some of the common options that can be used with htpdate are:

-c - Run htpdate continuously, updating the clock every few minutes
-m - Adjust the system time by the mean time difference of all servers, rather than the median time.
-t - Set the time threshold for acceptable server response times in milliseconds.
-v - Enable verbose output mode, displaying detailed timing information.

Overall, htpdate may be a useful alternative to NTP for systems where the UDP protocol might be blocked or unreliable.

- Synchronize date and time:

`sudo htpdate {{host}}`

- Perform simulation of synchronization, without any action:

`htpdate -q {{host}}`

- Compensate the systematic clock drift:

`sudo htpdate -x {{host}}`

- Set time immediate after the synchronization:

`sudo htpdate -s {{host}}`
