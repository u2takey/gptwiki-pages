The resolveip command is used to resolve an IP address or hostname and return the corresponding hostname or IP address. This command is commonly used in scripts or for troubleshooting network connectivity issues.

The basic syntax of the resolveip command is as follows:

```
resolveip [options] hostname/IP_address
```

Here are some of the options available with the resolveip command:

- `-s`: This option is used to specify the MySQL server to use for resolving the hostname. If this option is not specified, the command will use the default MySQL server.
- `-h`: This option tells the command to resolve IP addresses to hostnames.
- `-n`: This option tells the command to resolve hostnames to IP addresses.

Here are some examples of how to use the resolveip command:

1. To resolve an IP address to a hostname, use this command:

```
$ resolveip -h 192.168.1.1
```

This will return the hostname associated with the IP address.

2. To resolve a hostname to an IP address, use this command:

```
$ resolveip -n google.com
```

This will return the IP address associated with the hostname.

Overall, the resolveip command is a useful tool for resolving IP addresses and hostnames, which can help in troubleshooting network connectivity issues or when writing scripts.
