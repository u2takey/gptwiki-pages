The command "startx" is used to start the X Window System on a Linux or Unix-based operating system. 

Here's how the command works: 

1. The command is entered into the terminal or command line interface by the user. 

2. The X Window System is launched, which provides a graphical interface for the user to interact with the operating system. 

3. The X Window System loads the graphics drivers for the user's video card, and initializes the graphical environment. 

4. The X Window System loads the user's window manager, which is responsible for managing the user's graphical environment, and presenting a graphical user interface (GUI) for the user to interact with. 

5. The user is then presented with the graphical interface, and can use their mouse or other input devices to navigate and interact with the operating system. 

Overall, the "startx" command is a crucial tool for Linux and Unix users who require a graphical interface for their computing needs.
