# xvfb-run

xvfb-run is a command used to run graphical applications without an X server on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It essentially creates a virtual X server (Xvfb) that provides a display for the application to run on, and then it starts the application within this virtual server.

The general syntax for the xvfb-run command is as follows:

xvfb-run [OPTIONS] COMMAND

Where OPTIONS are any additional options that you want to pass to xvfb-run, and COMMAND is the command that you want to run within the virtual X server.

Some common options that you may want to use with xvfb-run include:

- -a: Specifies that you want the Xvfb server to automatically pick a display number, rather than specifying it manually.

- -s DISPLAY: Specifies the display number that you want to use for the Xvfb server. For example, -s ":99" would use display number 99.

- -n: Specifies that you want to disable the Xvfb X access control. This can be useful if you're trying to run an application that needs to access the X server directly.

Once you've set any desired options, you then specify the command that you want to run within the virtual X server. For example, if you wanted to run the Firefox web browser within the virtual X server, you could use the following command:

xvfb-run firefox

This would start a virtual X server, launch Firefox, and display the browser within the virtual X server.

Overall, the xvfb-run command is a useful tool for running graphical applications on Linux and other Unix-like systems in situations where a traditional X server is not available or desirable.

- Run the specified command in a virtual X server:

`xvfb-run {{command}}`

- Try to get a free server number, if the default (99) is not available:

`xvfb-run --auto-servernum {{command}}`

- Pass arguments to the Xvfb server:

`xvfb-run --server-args "{{-screen 0 1024x768x24}}" {{command}}`
