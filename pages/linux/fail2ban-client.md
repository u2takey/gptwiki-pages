Fail2ban-client is a command-line interface tool used to interact with the Fail2ban daemon. The command is used to manage the different Fail2ban functionalities like adding or removing a jail, checking the status of the Fail2ban service, debugging the service logs, and adding or removing rules from the jail.

Here are some of the most common options you can use with the Fail2ban-client command:

- `status`: This command is used to check the status of Fail2ban, including which jails are currently running, their current status, and how many IPs are currently banned. 

- `ping`: This command is used to check if the Fail2ban server is running and available.

- `get`: This command retrieves settings (like the ban time or the max retries) from the jail.

- `set`: This command is used to set a specific setting in the jail. 

- `start`: This command is used to start the Fail2ban service.

- `stop`: This command is used to stop the Fail2ban service.

- `reload`: This command is used to reload the Fail2ban service configuration file.

- `unban`: This command is used to unban an IP address from the jail.

- `ban`: This command is used to manually ban an IP address in the jail.

Fail2ban-client is a powerful tool that can help you secure your server by blocking malicious IP addresses.
