`pacman-key` is a command that is used in Arch Linux to manage the the Pacman package manager's database of trusted keys used to validate downloaded packages during installation. 

The command can be used to perform a number of actions including:

1. Listing keys: This command lists all the keys currently in the Pacman keyring along with their expiration dates if applicable.

2. Adding keys: This command adds a new key to the Pacman keyring. The key is typically obtained from a trusted source or a keyserver.

3. Removing keys: This command removes a key from the Pacman keyring. This is typically done when a key is no longer trusted or considered secure.

4. Refreshing keys: This command refreshes the Pacman keyring by downloading any missing keys from the configured keyserver.

5. Verifying keys: This command validates the authenticity of a key by comparing it to the keys in the keyring.

Overall, `pacman-key` is a very useful tool for managing the keys that are used by Pacman for package installation and ensuring software integrity.
