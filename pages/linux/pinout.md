The 'pinout' command is a Unix/Linux command used to display the Raspberry Pi's pinout diagram. The pinout program is used to display the pin diagrams for the various models of Raspberry Pi. 

When you execute the 'pinout' command in a terminal window, you will see an interactive diagram of the Raspberry Pi's pin layout. It shows the pin numbers, their function, and physical position on the board. 

The pinout diagram includes information about the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins, which are used to interact with other hardware components like sensors, motors, and other devices. The diagram also shows the power supply pins and ground pins.

Apart from the standard layout, pinout also shows the details of all the third-party add-ons connected to the Raspberry Pi. 

The 'pinout' command is useful for those who need to work with the Raspberry Pi's hardware components and need to know which pins to use for their projects. It's also great for troubleshooting issues with hardware, as it helps to pinpoint specific pins that may be causing a problem.
