As an AI language model, I don't have access to any specific command line tool or package called "betterdiscordctl." However, based on my research, I can tell you that "BetterDiscord" is a popular third-party extension for Discord that allows users to customize their Discord experience by adding features and themes that aren't available in the default Discord client. "betterdiscordctl" might be a command line tool specifically developed for managing BetterDiscord, such as changing settings, installing or uninstalling themes and plugins, or updating the extension. The exact usage and syntax of the command may vary based on the specific version of BetterDiscord and the operating system it's running on.
