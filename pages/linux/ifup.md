The 'ifup' command is a Linux command that is used to enable a network interface. It is commonly used to activate and configure network devices, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth adapters. 

When the 'ifup' command is executed, it reads the network configuration files and initializes the specified network interface. The 'ifup' command performs the following tasks:

1. Looks for the network interface specified in the command.
2. Checks whether the network interface is already enabled or not.
3. Configures the network interface according to the settings defined in the network configuration files.
4. Assigns an IP address to the network interface.
5. Sets up the routing table and DNS resolution for the interface.

The 'ifup' command can be used in conjunction with network configuration tools such as 'ifconfig' or 'ip' to configure network adapters. 

For example, the following command will enable the network interface named 'eth0':

ifup eth0

Once the network interface is enabled, it will be able to send and receive network traffic.
