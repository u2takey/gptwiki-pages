The `lvreduce` command is used in Linux and Unix-based operating systems to reduce the size of a logical volume (LV). Logical volumes are a way to manage and allocate storage space on a hard drive or storage device. 

The `lvreduce` command is typically used to reclaim space from a logical volume that is no longer required or to adjust the size of a logical volume to better fit the storage needs of the system. This command can only be used on logical volumes that have been created using the LVM (logical volume manager). 

The basic syntax of `lvreduce` command is:

```
lvreduce [options] <logical volume>
```

Here are some of the commonly used options of the `lvreduce` command:

- `--size`: This option specifies the new size for the logical volume. You can use this option to shrink the logical volume to a specific size, e.g. `--size 20G` will reduce the size to 20GB.

- `-r`: This option reduces the logical volume and also its file system at the same time. If the file system is not resized, then it may not be able to use the newly available space.

- `-f`: This option forces the reduction of the logical volume, even if there is a potential data loss due to the action.

Before using the `lvreduce` command, it is recommended to take a backup of the data on the logical volume to avoid any data loss. It is also important to make sure that the logical volume is unmounted before running the command.

- Reduce a volume's size to 120 GB:

`lvreduce --size {{120G}} {{logical_volume}}`

- Reduce a volume's size by 40 GB as well as the underlying filesystem:

`lvreduce --size -{{40G}} -r {{logical_volume}}`
