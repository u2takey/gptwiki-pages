The `w` command in Linux is used to show information about the users currently logged into the system, along with their processes. When the `w` command is executed, it displays the following information:

- User : The username of the user currently logged in
- TTY : The terminal name or line number associated with the user's session
- From : The IP address or hostname of the machine from which the user logged in
- Login@ : The time and date when the user logged in
- Idle : The amount of time that has passed since the user last interacted with the system
- JCPU : The CPU time used by all processes associated with the user's session
- PCPU : The percentage of CPU time used by the user's most CPU-intensive process
- Command : The name and arguments of the user's most recently executed command or process

The `w` command is particularly useful for system administrators who need to keep track of multiple users and their activities on a Linux system.
