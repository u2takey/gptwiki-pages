The `alien` command is a tool used for converting files from one package format to another. Specifically, it is used to convert files between the RPM (Red Hat Package Management) and DEB (Debian Package) formats. 

The command syntax takes the name of the file as an argument, along with any optional flags that may specify the target package format or other conversion settings. 

For example, to convert a DEB package to the RPM format, you would run:

```
alien -r package.deb
```

Where `-r` specifies the target RPM format. 

Note that while `alien` can be useful for quickly converting packages from one format to another, it may not always produce optimal results. It is generally recommended to use packages that are already available in your system's native package manager, rather than relying on conversions performed with `alien`.
