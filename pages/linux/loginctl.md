The `loginctl` command is used to manage user sessions and seats in Linux systems that use the Systemd init system. Here is a brief explanation of the available subcommands and their functions:

1. `loginctl list-sessions`: This command lists all active user sessions on the system, along with their session IDs, seat IDs, and various session details including the user ID, display, and remote host information.

2. `loginctl show-session [session-id]`: This command displays detailed information about a specific user session. You need to provide a session ID as an argument.

3. `loginctl session-status [session-id]`: This command displays the status of a specific user session. You need to provide a session ID as an argument.

4. `loginctl terminate-session [session-id]`: This command terminates a specific user session. You need to provide a session ID as an argument.

5. `loginctl list-users`: This command lists all users on the system along with their user IDs, last login times, and the number of active sessions for each user.

6. `loginctl show-user [user-id]`: This command displays detailed information about a specific user. You need to provide a user ID as an argument.

7. `loginctl enable-linger [user-id]`: This command enables user lingering for a specific user, meaning that their processes and sessions will continue to be running even after they log out. You need to provide a user ID as an argument.

8. `loginctl disable-linger [user-id]`: This command disables user lingering for a specific user. You need to provide a user ID as an argument.

In summary, the `loginctl` command is a useful tool for managing user sessions and seats on Linux systems. By using this command, system administrators can easily list all active sessions, display detailed information about specific sessions or users, terminate sessions, enable or disable user lingering, and much more.
