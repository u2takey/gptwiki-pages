The "mkfs.fat" command is used to create a file system on a storage device using the FAT filesystem. The FAT (File Allocation Table) is a simple and widely used file system that is compatible with most operating systems including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.

The "mkfs.fat" command typically requires the name of the device to be formatted as an argument. For example:

```
mkfs.fat /dev/sdb1
```

This command would create a FAT file system on the partition "sdb1".

By default, "mkfs.fat" creates a FAT32 file system, which allows larger file sizes and partition sizes than the older FAT16 file system. However, it is also possible to specify the use of FAT16 or even the older FAT12 file system by adding the appropriate options to the command.

The options available for "mkfs.fat" may vary depending on the version installed on the system, but common options include the following:

- "-F" specifies the type of FAT file system to create. For example, "-F 16" would create a FAT16 file system.
- "-n" specifies the volume label to be assigned to the file system.
- "-S" specifies the number of sectors per cluster. This can affect the maximum file size and the performance of the file system.
- "-s" specifies the number of reserved sectors on the file system. 

Overall, mkfs.fat is a simple and straightforward command that can be used to quickly create and format a FAT file system on a storage device.

- Create a fat filesystem inside partition 1 on device b (`sdb1`):

`mkfs.fat {{/dev/sdb1}}`

- Create filesystem with a volume-name:

`mkfs.fat -n {{volume_name}} {{/dev/sdb1}}`

- Create filesystem with a volume-id:

`mkfs.fat -i {{volume_id}} {{/dev/sdb1}}`

- Use 5 instead of 2 file allocation tables:

`mkfs.fat -f 5 {{/dev/sdb1}}`
