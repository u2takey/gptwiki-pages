The "ascii" command is used in computer programming and refers to the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). ASCII is a character encoding standard that assigns numerical values to letters, digits, symbols, and control characters in the English language. 

When the "ascii" command is executed, it typically displays a table of ASCII codes and corresponding characters. This table can be used for a variety of purposes, such as converting between ASCII codes and characters, checking ASCII codes for particular characters, or simply displaying the range of ASCII characters available.

For example, if you run the "ascii" command in a command prompt or terminal window, you might see a table like the following:

```
Dec  Hex  Char
0    00   NUL 
1    01   SOH 
2    02   STX 
3    03   ETX 
4    04   EOT 
5    05   ENQ 
6    06   ACK 
7    07   BEL 
8    08   BS  
9    09   HT  
10   0A   LF  
11   0B   VT  
12   0C   FF  
13   0D   CR  
14   0E   SO  
15   0F   SI  
... 
```

This table shows the decimal, hexadecimal, and character representation of each ASCII code from 0 to 255. The first column lists the decimal value of each code, the second lists the corresponding hexadecimal value, and the third lists the character or control symbol represented by that code.

Overall, the "ascii" command is a useful tool for working with ASCII codes and characters, especially in text-based programming environments.  So, it's a handy command for developers and programmers alike.
