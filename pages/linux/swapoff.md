The command "swapoff" is used in Linux systems to disable or turn off the active swap space. Swap space is used to extend the amount of available memory by swapping out unused data from RAM to a disk.

When swap space is not needed anymore, the "swapoff" command can be used to disable it. This will free up disk space and release any resources used by the swap space.

Here is the basic syntax of the "swapoff" command:

```
swapoff <device_name>
```

The "<device_name>" parameter specifies the device name or file path of the swap space to be turned off. For example, if the swap space is located on the "/dev/sda2" partition, the command would be:

```
swapoff /dev/sda2
```

If the swap space is created using a file, the file path should be used instead of the device name:

```
swapoff /swapfile
```

Using the "swapoff" command can be useful in situations where the system is running low on disk space or when troubleshooting issues related to memory usage. However, it should be used with caution as disabling the swap space may cause performance issues or system crashes if there is not enough physical memory to support the running processes.
