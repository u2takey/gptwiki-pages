# arithmetic 
## chatgpt 
As an AI language model, I don't know the context in which you came across the command 'arithmetic.' But usually, the term 'arithmetic' refers to a set of operations used in solving or working with mathematical problems involving numbers, and the command could be referring to software functions used for solving these mathematical problems. In computer programming, arithmetic usually refers to four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, using which complex operations and mathematical algorithms can be formulated. Many programming languages, such as C++, Python, Java, or MATLAB, have built-in arithmetic operators that can be used to perform mathematical computations. The use of such functions would depend on the specific problem you are trying to solve or the task at hand.

- Start an arithmetic quiz:

`arithmetic`

- Specify one or more arithmetic [o]peration symbols to get problems on them:

`arithmetic -o {{+|-|x|/}}`

- Specify a range. Addition and multiplication problems would feature numbers between 0 and range, inclusive. Subtraction and division problems would have required result and number to be operated on, between 0 and range:

`arithmetic -r {{7}}`
