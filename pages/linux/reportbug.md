reportbug is a command line tool used in Debian-based systems to report bugs in software packages. It generates a bug report that is sent to the Debian Bug Tracking System (BTS).

When you run the command "reportbug" on your terminal, it launches an interactive prompt that guides you through the bug reporting process. The prompt will ask for the package name that the bug is related to, a summary of the bug, and a description of the bug.

Once you have provided all the necessary information, reportbug generates a bug report along with any relevant system information that may help in resolving the bug. The bug report is then sent to the Debian BTS, and you receive a confirmation that the report has been successfully submitted.

Overall, the reportbug command is a quick and easy way for Debian users to report bugs in software packages, helping improve the stability and usability of the operating system.

`reportbug {{package}}`

- Report a bug that is not about a specific package (general problem, infrastructure, etc.):

`reportbug other`

- Write the bug report to a file instead of sending it by e-mail:
