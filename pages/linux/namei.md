The `namei` command is used in Linux-based operating systems to display the file path of a file or directory. It stands for "name identifier" and is also known as the "inode follow" command.

The syntax of the `namei` command is as follows:
```
namei [options] [path]
```

Here, `options` refer to the various command-line options that can be used with the `namei` command to control its behavior, and `path` refers to the path of the file or directory whose information needs to be displayed.

Some of the commonly used options with the `namei` command are as follows:
- `-m`: Displays the modes of the intermediate directories
- `-l`: Prints symbolic links in the output
- `-n`: Suppresses printing of the final newline character
- `-o`: Displays the owning user and group of each intermediate directory

The `namei` command works by following each component of the given `path` and displaying the inode number and mode of each directory and file along the way until it reaches the final destination. If a symbolic link is encountered, it is resolved and the resulting path is displayed.

For example, if the command `namei /home/user1/documents/report.txt` is entered, the output might look something like this:
```
f: /home/user1/documents/report.txt
 d /
 d home
 d user1
 d documents
 - report.txt
```

Here, the `namei` command displays the inode number (`f:`) and mode of the file `report.txt` along with the corresponding directories (`/`, `home`, `user1`, and `documents`) that lead up to it. The `-` sign next to `report.txt` indicates that it is a regular file.

- Resolve the pathnames specified as the argument parameters:

`namei {{path/to/a}} {{path/to/b}} {{path/to/c}}`

- Display the results in a long-listing format:

`namei --long {{path/to/a}} {{path/to/b}} {{path/to/c}}`

- Show the mode bits of each file type in the style of `ls`:

`namei --modes {{path/to/a}} {{path/to/b}} {{path/to/c}}`

- Show owner and group name of each file:

`namei --owners {{path/to/a}} {{path/to/b}} {{path/to/c}}`

- Don't follow symlinks while resolving:

`namei --nosymlinks {{path/to/a}} {{path/to/b}} {{path/to/c}}`
