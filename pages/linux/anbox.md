Anbox is not a command itself, but rather an application that allows you to run Android applications on your Linux operating system. To use Anbox, you will need to first install it on your Linux system and configure it properly. Here are the steps you can follow to install and use Anbox:

1. Check whether your system supports Anbox by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```lspci | grep -i android```

    This command will check whether your system has virtualization support for Android.

2. Install Anbox using the package manager of your Linux distribution. For example, if you are using Ubuntu, run the following commands:

    ```
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:morphis/anbox-support
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install anbox-modules-dkms
    sudo modprobe ashmem_linux
    sudo modprobe binder_linux
    sudo snap install --devmode --beta anbox
    ```
    If you're not using Ubuntu, you can refer to Anbox's documentation to install it on your Linux distribution.

3. After installing Anbox, launch it by running:

    ```
    anbox session-manager
    ```
    This command will start the Anbox session, which is similar to running an Android emulator.

4. Once the Anbox session starts, you can launch any Android application by opening the launcher and selecting the app you want to use.

Overall, Anbox is a useful tool for running Android applications on Linux, and it can help you make the most of your Linux system while having access to your favorite Android apps.
