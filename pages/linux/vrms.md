# vrms

The command "vrms" stands for "virtual Richard M. Stallman". It is a command found in Debian-based Linux distributions, which checks whether the system has any proprietary or non-free software installed.

When executed, the command first retrieves a list of all installed packages on the system. It then filters through this list, locating and identifying any packages that may be considered non-free or proprietary, using a database of Debian's non-free distribution.

The output generated by the vrms command consists of two parts. The first part is a list of all the non-free software packages found on the system. The second part lists any free software packages that have corresponding non-free counterparts.

The idea behind the vrms command is to provide users with a means to evaluate the extent to which they are relying on proprietary or non-free tools in their work. By identifying software that violates the most basic principles of software freedom, the command allows users to understand the kinds of trade-offs they may be making when choosing to use certain tools over others.
