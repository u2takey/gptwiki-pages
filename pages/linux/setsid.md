# setsid 
## chatgpt 
The "setsid" command is a Unix/Linux command that allows a process to be started in a new session with a new process group ID. The process started with the setsid command will be the leader of its own session, which is a logical grouping of processes that can be controlled and monitored as a single unit.

When you run the "setsid" command, it creates a new session and assigns the command you specify as the session leader. The session leader will be able to handle signals generated by the terminal, which means that even if you close the terminal, the process will not terminate. It also redirects standard input, output, and error streams to /dev/null, which means that it will not receive input from the terminal or send output to it.

The "setsid" command is commonly used to ensure that a process runs in the background and is not affected by events such as receiving a SIGHUP signal or losing its controlling terminal. It can also be used to run a command as a daemon or to run a command in the background so that it does not interrupt other tasks.

- Run a program in a new session:

`setsid {{program}}`

- Run a program in a new session discarding the resulting output and error:

`setsid {{program}} > /dev/null 2>&1`

- Run a program creating a new process:

`setsid --fork {{program}}`

- Return the exit code of a program as the exit code of setsid when the program exits:

`setsid --wait {{program}}`

- Run a program in a new session setting the current terminal as the controlling terminal:

`setsid --ctty {{program}}`
