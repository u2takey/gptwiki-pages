`nitrogen` is a Linux desktop wallpaper setter that allows you to set desktop wallpaper or background images. 

When executed, `nitrogen` presents a simple user interface that allows you to browse and select images to use as your desktop wallpaper. The interface also allows you to set the wallpaper mode, which can be set to "center", "zoom", "stretch", or "tile", allowing you to control how the wallpaper will be displayed on the desktop. Additionally, you can rotate the wallpaper and configure it to display in a certain order (e.g., shuffle).

`nitrogen` also provides a command-line interface that allows you to set the wallpaper from a command line. This can be useful if you want to incorporate setting the wallpaper into a script or bind a shortcut key to it. 

Overall, `nitrogen` is a useful tool for customizing your Linux desktop wallpaper.
