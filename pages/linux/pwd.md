# pwd 
## chatgpt 
`pwd` stands for "print working directory". When this command is entered in a terminal or command prompt, it will show the current working directory. 

The current working directory is the directory that the user is currently working in or the present directory. It is the location in the file system where any commands or programs executed within the terminal or command prompt will take place. 

The output of `pwd` will show the full path of the present working directory. For example, if the user is currently working in the "Documents" folder under the user's home directory, the output of `pwd` will be something like `/Users/username/Documents`. 

Overall, the `pwd` command is a basic but essential command that can be helpful in navigating and understanding the file system hierarchy.
