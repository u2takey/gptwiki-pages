# unzipsfx 
## chatgpt 
unzipsfx is a command used to extract self-extracting ZIP archives. A self-extracting ZIP archive is a special type of archive that contains both the compressed data and a program to extract the archive's contents. Unlike regular ZIP archives, which require a separate program to extract the contents, self-extracting ZIP archives can be extracted simply by running the archive file.

When the unzipsfx command is run, it extracts the contents of the self-extracting ZIP archive and saves them to the current directory. The options available with the unzipsfx command allow users to specify the destination directory and control various other aspects of the extraction process.

Here's an example of how to use the unzipsfx command:

unzipsfx my_archive.exe -d /home/user/extracted_files

In this example, the unzipsfx command is being used to extract the contents of a self-extracting ZIP archive called "my_archive.exe" to the "/home/user/extracted_files" directory. The "-d" option is used to specify the destination directory. Once the command is executed, the contents of the archive will be extracted and saved to the specified directory.

> More information: <https://manned.org/unzipsfx>.

- Create a self-extracting binary file of a `zip` archive:

`cat unzipsfx {{path/to/archive.zip}} > {{filename}} && chmod 755 {{filename}}`

- Extract a self-extracting binary in the current directory:

`{{./path/to/binary)}}`

- Test a self-extracting binary for errors:

`{{./path/to/binary)}} -t`

- Print content of a file in the self-extracting binary without extraction:

`{{./path/to/binary)}} -c {{path/to/filename}}`

- Print comments on `zip` archive in the self-extracting binary:

`{{./path/to/binary)}} -z`
