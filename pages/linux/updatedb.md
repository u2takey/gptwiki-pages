The "updatedb" command is used to update or refresh the database used by the locate command in Unix/Linux operating systems. The locate command uses a database that contains a list of all files and directories on the system to quickly search for specific files without having to search the entire system. 

When you run the "updatedb" command, it searches the entire file system, including mounted devices, for any new or changed files, and updates the database to reflect those changes. This makes sure that the locate command can find the latest files on your system.

The updatedb command is usually run by the system administrator or through a scheduled task to maintain and update the system's file lists. It is a quick process that takes only a few minutes or less to complete, depending on the size of the file system.

In summary, the updatedb command is used to update the database used by the locate command in Unix/Linux operating systems to make sure it can find the latest files on your system quickly.
