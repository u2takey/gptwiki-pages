lnav is a command-line tool used for log file analysis. It enables users to view and navigate through multiple log files on the terminal in a convenient manner. Here's a brief explanation of lnav's command options and their functionalities:

1. -c, --config: This option allows users to specify a configuration file that lnav should use for customizing its behavior.

2. -d, --delimiter: This option sets the delimiter used in the input file to separate data fields.

4. -h, --help: This option displays a list of all lnav command options and their usage.

5. -i, --index: This option enforces the creation of an index for log files. An index is a preprocessed file format that helps lnav find the requested data more quickly.

6. -n, --no-pager: This option disables the default system pager for output, allowing users to redirect output to other commands or files.

7. -q, --quiet: This option suppresses all non-critical messages and errors.

8. -t, --time: This option allows users to specify a time format that lnav should use when displaying log file timestamps.

9. -v, --verbose: This option enables verbose output mode, which provides additional information to users.

10. -w, --watchdog: This option sets a time interval for lnav to check the log file for changes and update the display accordingly.

Overall, lnav is a powerful log file analysis tool that empowers users to better understand and navigate their log files with ease.
