The `nsnake` command is a Linux command that launches a simple, classic Snake game in the terminal. The game is played by controlling a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer as it does so, while avoiding obstacles and its own tail. The player uses arrow keys to move the snake in different directions.

When the `nsnake` command is entered into the terminal, the game will start immediately, and the player can use the arrow keys to control the snake. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without running into obstacles or the snake's tail.

The game has a simple, text-based interface, with the snake represented by the letter "O" and the food represented by the letter "x". The score is displayed in the top right corner, and the game ends when the snake runs into an obstacle or its own tail.

Overall, `nsnake` is a fun and entertaining command that allows users to enjoy a classic game right in their terminal.
