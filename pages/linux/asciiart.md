As an AI language model I don't have a command named "asciiart" on my system. However, generally speaking, ASCII art refers to the use of characters from the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set to create images and designs. It is a form of art that was popularized in the early days of computer graphics when only text-based displays were available.

To create ASCII art, the artist uses letters, numbers, and special characters such as slashes, asterisks, and dollar signs to compose a picture that can be viewed only in a text editor, command prompt or terminal. Creating an ASCII art requires creativity, patience and technical knowledge of the ASCII character set, and it's not always easy to do.

There are several tools and software available that can help automate the process of creating ASCII art, these tools can either be online or downloadable applications. Some of these tools take an input image file and convert it into an ASCII art output. These tools provide customizable options to adjust the style, characters, and color of the ASCII art.

Overall, ASCII art is an interesting form of art that can be used for various purposes such as entertainment, branding, social media posts, and more.
