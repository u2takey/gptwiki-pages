Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I don't have direct access to a command line interface or environment to perform specific commands. However, I can provide some general information about the "powerstat" command that might be helpful.

The "powerstat" command is related to monitoring the power consumption of a computer. It is a Linux command that allows you to track the power usage of your device, including the CPU and GPU power consumption, using a tool called PowerTOP.

PowerTOP is a utility that analyzes how much power is consumed by each component of a computer and provides recommendations to reduce power consumption. It can be used to optimize your system settings or to diagnose power management issues.

Some common flags/options associated with the "powerstat" command include:
- "-d" or "--duration" followed by a number to specify the duration of monitoring in seconds.
- "-p" or "--show-pkg" to show the power consumption of the package (combination of CPU and DRAM).
- "-u" or "--show-duty-cycles" to show the duty cycles for each CPU core.
- "-h" or "--help" to display the help menu.

Overall, the "powerstat" command is a useful tool for optimizing power management and energy efficiency on Linux-based computers.

- Measure power with the default of 10 samples with an interval of 10 seconds:

`powerstat`

- Measure power with custom number of samples and interval duration:

`powerstat {{interval}} {{number_of_samples}}`

- Measure power using Intel's RAPL interface:

`powerstat -R {{interval}} {{number_of_samples}}`

- Show a histogram of the power measurements:

`powerstat -H {{interval}} {{number_of_samples}}`

- Enable all statistics gathering options:

`powerstat -a {{interval}} {{number_of_samples}}`
