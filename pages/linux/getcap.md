# getcap 
## chatgpt 
The 'getcap' command is a Linux utility that is used to retrieve the capabilities of an executable file. The capabilities of a file are a set of permissions that are granted to a process that is executing the file. The capabilities of an executable file are used to provide a more fine-grained level of access control when compared to the traditional Unix file permissions.

The 'getcap' command takes the absolute path of the executable file as its parameter and returns a list of capabilities that are associated with the file. If there are no capabilities associated with the file, the 'getcap' command will return an empty result.

For example, to get the capabilities of the '/usr/bin/gnome-terminal' executable file, the following command would be used:

```
getcap /usr/bin/gnome-terminal
```

The output of the command might look like this:

```
/usr/bin/gnome-terminal = cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_ptrace+ep
```

In this example, the 'gnome-terminal' executable file has two capabilities associated with it: 'cap_ipc_lock' and 'cap_sys_ptrace+ep'. The 'cap_ipc_lock' capability allows the process to lock memory pages in the system and the 'cap_sys_ptrace+ep' capability allows the process to trace the execution of any process on the system, even those owned by other users.

- Get capabilities for the given files:

`getcap {{path/to/file1 path/to/file2 ...}}`

- Get capabilities for all the files recursively under the given directories:

`getcap -r {{path/to/directory1 path/to/directory2 ...}}`

- Displays all searched entries even if no capabilities are set:

`getcap -v {{path/to/file1 path/to/file2 ...}}`
