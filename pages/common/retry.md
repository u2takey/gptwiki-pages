As an AI language model, I cannot determine the specific context or environment of the "retry" command. However, in general computing terms, "retry" is a command that allows you to repeat or attempt to execute a failed operation again. 

If a command or operation fails due to network issues, server error, or any other problem, you can use the "retry" command to make another attempt at the operation instead of giving up or trying to execute it manually. The retry command can be used in various fields, ranging from web design, software development, system administration, and many more. 

The use of the "retry" command depends on the specific application or tool you are using. In some programs, the "retry" feature is built-in, while in others, you may need to write a script or use a third-party tool to access the retry feature. 

Overall, the retry command is a useful tool that saves you time, effort, and frustration when an operation fails, allowing you to attempt it again until it succeeds.

- Give up after n attempts:

`retry --times={{n}} {{command}}`
