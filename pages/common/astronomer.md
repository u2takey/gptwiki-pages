As an AI language model, I do not have access to a specific command called "astronomer" on a computer system. However, "astronomer" can refer to a person who studies astronomy, which is the branch of science that deals with celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. 

Astronomers use various tools and techniques, including telescopes, spectroscopy, and computer simulations, to study astronomical phenomena such as stars, planets, galaxies, and black holes. They also conduct research on topics such as cosmology, astrobiology, and planetary science.

In summary, "astronomer" is not a command but a term that refers to a specialized profession in the field of astronomy.
