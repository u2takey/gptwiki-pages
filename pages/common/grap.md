I'm sorry, I cannot provide an explanation for the command 'grap' as it is not a recognized command in most operating systems. It may refer to a specific program or utility which would require more context to provide a proper explanation. Could you please provide more information about the environment or context where this command is being used?

- Process a `grap` file and save the output file for future processing with `pic` and `groff`:

`grap {{path/to/input.grap}} > {{path/to/output.pic}}`

- Typeset a `grap` file to PDF using the [me] macro package, saving the output to a file:

`grap {{path/to/input.grap}} | pic -T {{pdf}} | groff -{{me}} -T {{pdf}} > {{path/to/output.pdf}}`
