Qdbus is a command-line tool that allows users to interact with D-Bus message buses. It is typically used to perform introspection on D-Bus objects, send and receive D-Bus messages, and manage D-Bus-related tasks.

Some common use cases for qdbus include:

- Querying the state of D-Bus objects: qdbus can be used to list the objects on a given message bus and retrieve information about their properties and methods.
- Sending D-Bus messages: qdbus can be used to send messages to D-Bus objects, both as signals and method calls.
- Registering and unregistering objects and services: qdbus can be used to register new objects or services on a D-Bus message bus, as well as unregister them when they're no longer needed.
- Controlling the behavior of message buses: qdbus can be used to start and stop message buses, change their configuration settings, and force a bus to reload its configuration files.

To use qdbus, you'll typically need to specify the message bus you want to interact with (e.g. --system to work with the system bus or --session to work with the user's session bus) and the object path you want to query or manipulate. You can then use a variety of flags and subcommands to perform the specific task you're interested in.

For example, to list all of the objects on the system bus, you might use the following command:

```
qdbus --system org.freedesktop.DBus /org/freedesktop/DBus org.freedesktop.DBus.ListNames
```

This command tells qdbus to connect to the system bus (using the org.freedesktop.DBus service), query the root of the object tree (/org/freedesktop/DBus), and call the ListNames method on that object to retrieve a list of the names of all currently registered bus names.

Other useful qdbus subcommands include:

- `introspect`: Retrieves information about a specific D-Bus object, including its properties, methods, and signals.
- `call`: Calls a method on a D-Bus object and retrieves its result (if any).
- `monitor`: Listens for all D-Bus signals on a given bus and displays them as they're received.
- `register`: Registers a new object or service on a D-Bus message bus.
- `unregister`: Unregisters an object or service from a D-Bus message bus.

Overall, qdbus is a powerful and flexible tool for working with D-Bus message buses and objects, and can be used to perform a wide range of tasks related to inter-process communication in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

- List available service names:

`qdbus`

- List object paths for a specific service:

`qdbus {{service_name}}`

- List methods, signals and properties available on a specific object:

`qdbus {{service_name}} {{/path/to/object}}`

- Execute a specific method passing arguments and display the returned value:

`qdbus {{service_name}} {{/path/to/object}} {{method_name}} {{argument1}} {{argument2}}`

- Display the current brightness value in a KDE Plasma session:

`qdbus {{org.kde.Solid.PowerManagement}} {{/org/kde/Solid/PowerManagement/Actions/BrightnessControl}} {{org.kde.Solid.PowerManagement.Actions.BrightnessControl.brightness}}`

- Set a specific brightness to a KDE Plasma session:

`qdbus {{org.kde.Solid.PowerManagement}} {{/org/kde/Solid/PowerManagement/Actions/BrightnessControl}} {{org.kde.Solid.PowerManagement.Actions.BrightnessControl.setBrightness}} {{5000}}`

- Invoke volume up shortcut in a KDE Plasma session:

`qdbus {{org.kde.kglobalaccel}} {{/component/kmix}} {{invokeShortcut}} "{{increase_volume}}"`

- Display help:

`qdbus --help`
