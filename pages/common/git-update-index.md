# git update-index

Git update-index is a Git command used to update the index (also known as the staging area) with changes made to the working directory. This means that after updating the index, Git will see the changes made to the files and treat them as staged changes.

The syntax for the git update-index command is:

```
git update-index [options] [--] [pathspec]
```

The options available in the command are:

- add: Adds the file contents to the index
- remove: Removes the file contents from the index
- chmod: Changes the execute permissions of the file
- assume-unchanged: Marks a file as unchanged even if it has been modified
- no-assume-unchanged: Reverts the assume-unchanged option
- intent-to-add: Adds a file that is not yet in the index but that you plan to add

The pathspec refers to the files or directories that you want to update. If no pathspec is given, the command will update all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

To use the git update-index command, you first need to change to the Git repository directory in your terminal or command prompt. Once you're in the right directory, you can use the command by specifying one of the options available along with the filepath or directory you want to work with.

For example, to add a single file to the index, you would run:

```
git update-index --add file.txt
```

This would add the file.txt file to the index so that it will be included in the next commit.

You can also use the command to add all files in a directory and its subdirectories:

```
git update-index --add .
```

This would add all files in the current directory and its subdirectories to the index.

Overall, the git update-index command is a powerful tool that you can use to update the index with files that you've modified, but that aren't yet staged for a commit.

- Pretend that a modified file is unchanged (`git status` will not show this as changed):

`git update-index --skip-worktree {{path/to/modified_file}}`
