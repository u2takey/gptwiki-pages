Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I don't have enough context to interpret "btm" as a command as it could have different meanings in different contexts. Can you please give me more information about where or how "btm" is being used so that I can provide you with a detailed explanation?

- Show the default layout (CPU, memory, temperatures, disk, network, and processes):

`btm`

- Enable basic mode, removing charts and condensing data (similar to `top`):

`btm --basic`

- Use big dots instead of small ones in charts:

`btm --dot_marker`

- Show also battery charge and health status:

`btm --battery`

- Refresh every 250 milliseconds and show the last 30 seconds in the charts:

`btm --rate 250 --default_time_value 30000`
