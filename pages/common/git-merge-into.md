# git merge-into 
## chatgpt 
I'm sorry, but the correct command is "git merge". There is no command called "git merge-into". 

The "git merge" command is used to combine two or more branches into one. This is done by taking the changes in one branch and applying them to another branch. The end result is a new branch that contains all of the changes from both branches.

Here's how to use the "git merge" command:

1. Start by checking out the branch that you want to merge into. This will be the branch that receives the changes from the other branch.

`git checkout <receiving-branch>`

2. Next, run the "git merge" command, followed by the name of the branch that you want to merge into the receiving branch.

`git merge <branch-to-merge>`

3. Git will attempt to automatically merge the changes from the other branch into the receiving branch. There may be conflicts that need to be resolved. If so, Git will prompt you to resolve the conflicts manually.

4. Once the merging is complete, you can commit the changes with the usual "git commit" command.

That's it! You've successfully merged one branch into another using Git.
