# virsh pool-start 
## chatgpt 
The `virsh pool-start` command is used to start a storage pool on a virtualization host managed by the libvirt library. A storage pool is a storage abstraction that provides a common interface for managing the storage of virtual machines.

Hereâ€™s what this command does in detail:

- `virsh`: This refers to the CLI (Command Line Interface) tool used to interact with virtualization hosts managed by the libvirt library.

- `pool-start`: This refers to the command to start a storage pool. It instructs the virtualization host to start the storage pool specified in the command.

In essence, running the `virsh pool-start` command will activate the specified storage pool, making it available for use by virtual machines running on the host. This will enable virtual machines to access data stored in the pool and write data into it.

- Start the storage pool specified by name or UUID (determine using `virsh pool-list`) and create the underlying storage system if it doesn't exist:

`virsh pool-start --pool {{name|uuid}} --build`
