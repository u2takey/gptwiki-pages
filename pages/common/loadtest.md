The command "loadtest" is typically used in the context of performance testing or load testing of web applications. It is a software tool or framework that enables testers to simulate multiple client requests to a web application, with the aim of assessing how well the application performs under heavy load.

The loadtest command typically involves generating a large number of virtual users or clients that send HTTP requests to the application. These requests are typically pre-defined scenarios that simulate different user traffic patterns, such as browsing, logging in, searching, or purchasing items. Each virtual user is often configured with a unique set of input parameters, such as a username and password, to ensure that the application can handle simultaneous user sessions.

As the loadtest command simulates multiple users, it measures various performance metrics, such as response time, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization. These metrics help testers to identify performance bottlenecks or other issues that may impact the application's ability to serve users effectively.

Overall, the loadtest command is a valuable tool for testing the scalability and reliability of web applications. It enables testers to anticipate and mitigate performance issues before they affect the end-users, ensuring a better user experience and optimal application performance.

- Run with concurrent users and a specified amount of requests per second:

`loadtest --concurrency {{10}} --rps {{200}} {{https://example.com}}`

- Run with a custom HTTP header:

`loadtest --headers "{{accept:text/plain;text-html}}" {{https://example.com}}`

- Run with a specific HTTP method:

`loadtest --method {{GET}} {{https://example.com}}`
