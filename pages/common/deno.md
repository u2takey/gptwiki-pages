"Deno" is not a complete command on its own, but rather the name of a runtime environment for JavaScript and TypeScript applications. It can be used as follows:

1. Installation: To use Deno, you first need to install it on your computer. This can be done by running the command `curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh` on a Unix-based system (such as macOS or Linux) with a shell environment, or by downloading an installer from the Deno website for Windows or macOS. Once installed, you can confirm that Deno is available by running the command `deno --version`.

2. Running a script: To execute a JavaScript or TypeScript file with Deno, you can simply enter the command `deno run <filename>` in a terminal window, where `<filename>` is replaced with the name of the file you want to run. Deno will automatically download and cache any external dependencies required by your script, and will execute it in a secure sandboxed environment that restricts access to sensitive system resources.

3. Using Deno modules: One of the key features of Deno is its support for importing modules directly from URLs. For example, if you want to use a third-party library in your project, you can simply import it using a URL like `import { someFunction } from 'https://cdn.example.com/library.js'`. Deno will download the module and cache it locally, so that subsequent executions of your script can run without requiring additional downloads.

Overall, Deno is a versatile and secure tool for running JavaScript and TypeScript applications, with many built-in features and a growing ecosystem of third-party modules.
