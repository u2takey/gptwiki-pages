The "for" command in a shell script is used to iterate through a list of items and perform a set of commands for each item in that list. The basic syntax of the for loop in Bash shell scripting is:

```
for var in list
do
    command1
    command2
    ...
done
```
where "var" is a variable that is used to store each item in the list, and "list" is a list of items separated by spaces. The commands within the "do" and "done" statements are executed for each item in the list.

For example, the following code uses a for loop to print the numbers 1 through 10:

```
for i in {1..10}
do
    echo $i
done
```

Here, "i" is the variable that represents each number in the list, and the "echo" command is used to print the value of "i" to the console.

The "for" command can also be used with other commands or shell scripts to perform more complex tasks, such as renaming or moving files, processing data in a CSV file, or performing system maintenance tasks.

- Iterate over a given range of numbers:

`for {{variable}} in {{{from}}..{{to}}..{{step}}}; do {{echo "Loop is executed"}}; done`

- Iterate over a given list of files:

`for {{variable}} in {{path/to/file1 path/to/file2 ...}}; do {{echo "Loop is executed"}}; done`

- Iterate over a given list of directories:

`for {{variable}} in {{path/to/directory1/ path/to/directory2/ ...}}; do {{echo "Loop is executed"}}; done`
