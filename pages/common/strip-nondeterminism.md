The `strip-nondeterminism` command is a tool used for making the build process of software applications more repeatable and deterministic. It is mainly used to remove non-deterministic information from files such as timestamps, random numbers, and embedded file paths. 

When generating binary packages and archives from software source code, various aspects of the build process may cause minor differences in the resulting files, even if the source code and build environment are the same. This can lead to undesirable effects such as package checksums being different across different builds, causing difficulty in verifying package integrity.

`strip-nondeterminism` tool helps in addressing these issues by normalizing the files generated during the build process. It does this by performing various transformations such as:

- Removing timestamps and file system metadata.
- Generating consistent build paths for files across different build environments.
- Normalizing whitespace and newline characters in text files.
- Ensuring consistent ordering of lists and hashes.

The `strip-nondeterminism` command is typically run as a post-processing step after the build process is complete. It can be invoked on individual files or entire directories. The tool is commonly used in the Debian and Ubuntu package build processes, but can be useful in other contexts as well. 

Overall, `strip-nondeterminism` is a tool that helps in making the build process more predictable and reliable, ultimately resulting in more stable software applications.

- Strip nondeterministic information from a file:

`strip-nondeterminism {{path/to/file}}`

- Strip nondeterministic information from a file manually specifying the filetype:

`strip-nondeterminism --type {{filetype}} {{path/to/file}}`

- Strip nondeterministic information from a file; instead of removing timestamps set them to the specified UNIX timestamp:

`strip-nondeterminism --timestamp {{unix_timestamp}} {{path/to/file}}`
