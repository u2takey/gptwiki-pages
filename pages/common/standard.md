As an AI language model, I am not completely sure about the context in which you are referring to the "standard" command. It would be helpful to know the operating system or software you are referring to. However, here is the general information on the term "standard" and how it is used in various contexts: 

- The term "standard" usually refers to something that is accepted or recognized as a normal or commonly used form, level, or criterion. 
- In programming, the term "standard" is used to describe a set of rules or guidelines that developers adhere to. These standards are designed to ensure that code is readable, maintainable, and consistent across different projects and team members. For example, there are coding style standards like the Google coding style or the PEP8 standard for Python, that define how code should be structured, indented, and commented. 
- In the Unix/Linux world, the "standard" command is usually used to print the standard input to the standard output. For example, the command "cat file.txt" would print the contents of "file.txt" to the terminal. But with "cat file.txt | standard", the contents of "file.txt" would be printed to the terminal as well. This command can be useful in piping input and output between different commands. 

As mentioned earlier, if you could provide more context in which the term/command "standard" is being used, I can provide a more tailored explanation.

- Apply automatic fixes during linting:

`standard --fix`

- Declare any available global variables:

- Use a custom ESLint plugin when linting:

`standard --plugin {{plugin}}`

- Use a custom JS parser when linting:

`standard --parser {{parser}}`

- Use a custom ESLint environment when linting:

`standard --env {{environment}}`
