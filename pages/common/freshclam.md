Freshclam is a command-line tool used for updating the virus definitions in the ClamAV antivirus software. ClamAV is an open-source antivirus program often used for Unix-like systems such as Linux or macOS. 

The freshclam command fetches the latest virus definition databases from ClamAV servers and updates the local database on the computer. The databases include signatures and other important information about known malware and viruses. 

Here's what freshclam does when it's executed:

1. Connects to the ClamAV server to check for new virus definitions.
2. Downloads any new databases or updates to the virus definitions.
3. Installs the new databases or updates and renames them to replace older versions.
4. Exits the command-line interface.

The freshclam command can be run manually or can be scheduled to run automatically at periodic intervals (using cron or the task scheduler, for example). It is important to keep the virus definitions up-to-date to ensure the highest level of protection against new malware and viruses.
