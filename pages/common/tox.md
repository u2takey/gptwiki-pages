Tox is a command-line tool for automating Python development workflow. When you run the "tox" command in your terminal, it will look for a "tox.ini" configuration file in your current directory. This file contains a set of instructions regarding how to create a consistent and isolated Python environment for your project.

Tox uses virtual environments to manage dependencies and isolate builds. It creates an environment for each specified Python version and runs the commands defined in the tox configuration file.

Tox simplifies testing, packaging, and distribution of your Python code by automating the creation of isolated test environments, running tests, and generating reports. It can also be used to automate the following tasks:

1. Installing dependencies
2. Running tests
3. Building packages
4. Uploading packages to PyPI

With Tox, you can easily test your Python code on various Python versions and environments without interfering with the rest of your system. The resulting build is repeatable and can be reliably used by other developers, regardless of their operating system or environment.

- Run tests on all test environments:

`tox`

- Create a `tox.ini` configuration:

`tox-quickstart`

- List the available environments:

`tox --listenvs-all`

- Run tests on a specific environment (e.g. python 3.6):

`tox -e {{py36}}`

- Force the virtual environment to be recreated:

`tox --recreate -e {{py27}}`
