The command `phpmd` stands for PHP Mess Detector. It is a command-line tool that analyzes PHP code and detects potential problems, inconsistencies, and bad practices.

When executed, `phpmd` allows you to specify the directory or file where your PHP code is located. It then analyzes the code and reports on any issues it finds.

Some of the issues that `phpmd` can detect include:

- Unused code
- Code complexity
- Overcomplicated expressions
- Unnecessary or redundant code
- Code that violates coding standards
- Code that is difficult to read or maintain

`phpmd` provides a comprehensive list of rules that it uses to analyze the code. You can customize which rules should be applied to your code by specifying a configuration file.

Overall, `phpmd` is a powerful tool for improving the quality of your PHP code and ensuring that it meets coding standards and best practices.

- Display a list of available rulesets and formats:

`phpmd`

- Scan a file or directory for problems using comma-separated rulesets:

`phpmd {{path/to/file_or_directory}} {{xml|text|html}} {{rulesets}}`

- Specify the minimum priority threshold for rules:

`phpmd {{path/to/file_or_directory}} {{xml|text|html}} {{rulesets}} --minimumpriority {{priority}}`

- Include only the specified extensions in analysis:

`phpmd {{path/to/file_or_directory}} {{xml|text|html}} {{rulesets}} --suffixes {{extensions}}`

- Exclude the specified comma-separated directories:

`phpmd {{path/to/file_or_directory}} {{xml|text|html}} {{rulesets}} --exclude {{directory_patterns}}`

- Output the results to a file instead of `stdout`:

`phpmd {{path/to/file_or_directory}} {{xml|text|html}} {{rulesets}} --reportfile {{path/to/report_file}}`

- Ignore the use of warning-suppressive PHPDoc comments:

`phpmd {{path/to/file_or_directory}} {{xml|text|html}} {{rulesets}} --strict`
