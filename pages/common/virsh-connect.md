# virsh-connect 
## chatgpt 
The "virsh connect" command is used in virtualization management using Libvirt API to establish and control remote connections with hypervisors. This command is used to establish a connection to the hypervisor for managing virtual machines (VMs) running on it.

The command connects to a specified hypervisor and provides access to the virtual machines and related resources. It allows users to remotely control and monitor the operation and configuration of the VMs, create and destroy VMs, manage networking, storage, and other virtual resources.

The basic syntax of the command is:

virsh connect URI

Where URI is the address of the hypervisor to connect to. The URI can be in different formats depending on the hypervisor, such as:

- qemu:///system
- qemu+ssh://user@host/system
- xen:///
- lxc:///system

The "virsh-connect" command can also be used with other options and arguments to specify the type of connection, authentication credentials, and other settings.

Overall, the "virsh connect" command is an essential tool for managing virtual machines and hypervisors, especially in server environments where multiple hosts and VMs need to be controlled remotely.

- Connect to the default hypervisor:

`virsh connect`

- Connect as root to the local QEMU/KVM hypervisor:

`virsh connect qemu:///system`

- Launch a new instance of the hypervisor and connect to it as the local user:

`virsh connect qemu:///session`

- Connect as root to a remote hypervisor using ssh:

`virsh connect qemu+ssh://{{user_name@host_name}}/system`
