The `vue serve` command is a command-line utility command used to serve a Vue.js application during development. 

When you execute the `vue serve` command in the terminal, it will search for a `.vue` file in the current working directory and compile it into a standalone HTML file with an embedded script tag. This script tag links to the compiled JavaScript from the Vue.js application. 

This command also automatically re-compiles the `.vue` file and refreshes the browser window whenever any changes occur to the Vue.js application, which makes it very convenient during the development stage.

In order to use the `vue serve` command, you need to install the `@vue/cli-service-global` package globally on your system. Once installed, you can run the `vue serve` command in your terminal by typing `vue serve` followed by the name of the `.vue` file you want to serve. 

For example, if you have a `main.vue` file in your current directory, you can serve it using the `vue serve` command by running:

```
vue serve main.vue
```

This will start the development server and open the Vue.js application in your default web browser.
