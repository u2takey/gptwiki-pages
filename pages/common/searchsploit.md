searchsploit is a command-line utility tool used in Kali Linux for searching exploits and vulnerable software in different exploit databases. It uses the command-line interface (CLI) and can perform a quick and accurate search to find useful information on different exploits.

When executed, searchsploit searches a local copy of the Exploit Database, which contains exploits and vulnerability information for various OS, software platforms, and applications. The searchsploit command can be used to search for a specific exploit, OS name/version, application name/version, or CVE identifier.

Syntax:
searchsploit [options] term

Here, term refers to the search term, which can be an exploit name or a keyword.

Options:
-i, --interactive: Lists the Exploit Database in menu form, allowing the user to select an exploit by number. The user can then view the full details of the exploit, copy the exploit to a local folder, or open the exploit in a text editor.

-t, --title: Searches for the keyword in the title or name of the exploit.

-d, --database: Allows the user to select a specific exploit database from the ones available, including exploits and vulnerability information collected by Offensive Security, OSVDB, Metasploit, and others.

-m, --mirror: Sets the mirror for the search, which is the source of the data. This option allows the user to specify a different exploit database to search.

-f, --file: Searches for the specified file or software in the exploit database.

-h, --help: Displays the help menu for the searchsploit command.

Examples:
1. searchsploit apache
This will search the exploit database for any exploits related to the Apache web server.

2. searchsploit -i
This option lists the Exploit Database in a menu format, where the user can select an exploit from the database.

3. searchsploit -t wordpress
This command will search the database for exploits related to WordPress, a popular content management system.

4. searchsploit -d metasploit
The -d option allows the user to specify a specific exploit database to search, in this case, the Metasploit database.

Overall, searchsploit is a crucial tool for penetration testers and ethical hackers who want to detect vulnerabilities in the system, web application, or network environment. It allows them to locate potential exploits that can be used to penetrate and test the security of the target system.

> Searchsploit searches exploit database's database for exploits, shellcodes and/or papers.
> If known version numbers are used as search terms, exploits for both the exact version and others whose version range covers the one specified are shown.

- Search for an exploit, shellcode, or paper:

`searchsploit {{search_terms}}`

- Search for a known specific version, e.g. sudo version 1.8.27:

`searchsploit sudo 1.8.27`

- Show the exploit-db link to the found resources:

`searchsploit --www {{search_terms}}`

- Make a copy of the resource to the current directory (requires the number of the exploit):

`searchsploit --mirror {{exploit_number}}`

- Open the resource to read with the pager defined in the `$PAGER` environment variable:

`searchsploit --explore {{exploit_number}}`

- Update the local exploit database:

`searchsploit --update`
