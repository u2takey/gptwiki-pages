# git standup

The `git standup` command is not a default Git command. It is actually a third-party command provided by the `git-standup` tool, which needs to be installed separately.

Once installed, `git standup` is used to show a quick summary of the recent work done in a Git repository by the current user or a specific author. The output includes a list of the commits made by that author in the last day (by default), along with the commit message, date, and branch name.

The primary purpose of this command is to help developers quickly catch up on what they or their team members have recently accomplished in the repository, which can be challenging when working on a large codebase with many contributors.

Here are some of the most commonly used options with `git standup`:

- `-a <author>` or `--author=<author>`: Filters the results to only show commits made by a specific author.
- `-d <days>` or `--days=<days>`: Changes the default time frame for the summary to the specified number of days. For example, to see the last 7 days, you can use `-d 7`.
- `-w <path>` or `--working-directory=<path>`: Sets the working directory for the command. By default, it assumes the current working directory to be the Git repository's root directory.

For more information about `git-standup` and its usage, you can refer to its official documentation.
