miniserve is a command line tool used to quickly start a static file server. It is designed to serve files in the current directory, making it easy to share files and view them on a web browser.

When executed, the miniserve command launches a web server that listens to incoming requests on a specified port (by default, port 8080). It serves files from the current directory, allowing users to access and view them in a web browser. 

Miniserve is also designed with security in mind. It uses HTTPS by default and generates a self-signed certificate when no SSL certificate is provided. This ensures that all data transmitted between the server and the client is encrypted and secure. 

The miniserve command has a few options that can be used to customize its behavior, including the ability to restrict access to the server using a password, limiting the number of concurrent connections, and changing the root directory from which the files are served. 

Overall, miniserve is a simple and easy-to-use tool for quickly sharing files and web content with others. It provides a secure, lightweight, and fast way to start a static file server, making it a great choice for developers, designers, and anyone who needs to share files quickly and easily.
