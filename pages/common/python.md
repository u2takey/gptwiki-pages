"python" is a command that allows the execution of Python code in the command-line interface. 

When the "python" command is entered in the terminal or command prompt, the Python interpreter is loaded, and it waits for the user to input a command. Then, the interpreter reads the command and executes it. 

For example, if you type "print('Hello, World!')" after the "python" command, the interpreter will execute the command and output "Hello, World!" on the next line.

Additionally, you can use "python" to execute Python scripts saved as .py files. In this case, you would enter "python script.py" to run the script.
