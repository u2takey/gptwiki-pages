"Heroku" is a cloud-based platform that allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale their web applications. In order to use Heroku, developers need to use a command-line tool called the Heroku CLI.

The command "heroku" is the main command used with the Heroku CLI, and it allows developers to interact with their Heroku account and perform various actions. Some of the most common actions that can be performed using "heroku" include:

- Creating and deploying new applications to the Heroku platform
- Managing and scaling existing Heroku applications
- Viewing and managing the logs generated by a Heroku application
- Configuring environment variables and other application settings
- Running one-off tasks or executing commands on a Heroku dyno (a lightweight Linux container used to run Heroku applications)

Overall, the "heroku" command is an essential tool for any developer who is working with the Heroku platform, as it provides easy access to a wide range of functionality and makes it easy to manage and deploy web applications.
