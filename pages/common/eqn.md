The `eqn` command is a Unix command that is used to create equations and mathematical formulas. It is a typesetting language that is designed to be used in conjunction with typesetting programs such as troff or TeX to format equations and mathematical expressions.

When you run the `eqn` command, you are presented with a text editor in which you can write your equation. The syntax and formatting of the equation are based on a set of rules and conventions that are designed to make it easy to create complex mathematical expressions.

Once you have entered your equation into the `eqn` editor, you can save it to a file or pipe it into a typesetting program such as troff or TeX. The typesetting program will then use the information in the `eqn` file to generate a formatted mathematical expression that can be printed or displayed on screen.

Overall, the `eqn` command is a powerful tool for creating equations and mathematical expressions on Unix systems. It allows you to create professional-looking mathematical expressions with a high degree of precision and control, making it an essential tool for scientists, engineers, and other professionals who work with complex mathematical concepts.

- Process input with equations, saving the output for future typesetting with groff to PostScript:

`eqn {{path/to/input.eqn}} > {{path/to/output.roff}}`

- Typeset an input file with equations to PDF using the [me] macro package:

`eqn -T {{pdf}} {{path/to/input.eqn}} | groff -{{me}} -T {{pdf}} > {{path/to/output.pdf}}`
