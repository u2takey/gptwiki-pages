The `godoc` command is a command-line tool in Go programming language that generates documentation for Go packages. When you run the `godoc` command, it starts a web server that serves the documentation in your browser.

To use `godoc`, you need to have Go installed on your system. Once you have Go installed, you can run the `godoc` command in terminal or command prompt.

By default, the `godoc` command starts a web server on port 6060. You can access the documentation by typing `http://localhost:6060` in your web browser. Once you're on the documentation server page, you'll see the list of packages that are installed on your system. You can click on any package to view its documentation.

`godoc` also supports searching for packages and functions. You can search for packages and functions using the search bar at the top of the server page.

The `godoc` command also supports generating documentation in various formats such as HTML, Markdown, and plain text. You can generate documentation in a specific format by passing the `-html`, `-markdown`, or `-text` flag followed by the name of the package you want to generate documentation for. The generated documentation will be saved to your current directory.

For example, the following command generates documentation for the `fmt` package in HTML format:

```
godoc -html fmt > fmt_doc.html
```

This command generates documentation for the `fmt` package in Markdown format:

```
godoc -markdown fmt > fmt_doc.md
```

Overall, the `godoc` command is a useful tool for generating and browsing Go documentation in a simple and convenient way.
