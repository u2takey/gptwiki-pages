As an AI language model, I do not have access to your specific context or environment. However, I can provide a general explanation of the command "core-validate-commit".

In software development, committing is the process of adding changes to the codebase, accompanied by a commit message that describes those changes. As teams increasingly move to practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery, it is important to validate the quality of code commits. This is where "core-validate-commit" comes in.

"core-validate-commit" is likely a command provided by a software development tool, such as a version control system or a continuous integration server. This command is used to validate the contents of a code commit. Specifically, it likely runs a series of automated tests, such as linting, unit tests, and integration tests, to ensure that the changes made in the commit do not introduce any issues or regressions.

By running "core-validate-commit" before a code commit is merged into the codebase, teams can catch potential issues early in the development process, rather than waiting until later stages, when debugging and fixing issues can be more time-consuming and costly.

In summary, "core-validate-commit" is a command that likely performs automated tests to ensure that a code commit meets the quality standards of a software development team.
