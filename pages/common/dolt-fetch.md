The `dolt fetch` command is used in Dolt, a database management system that provides Git-like version control and collaboration features. It performs a similar task to Git's `git fetch` command, which updates the local repository with changes from a remote repository.

When you run `dolt fetch`, it communicates with the remote repository and retrieves any changes that have been made since the last time you fetched or pulled data from it. The changes are then stored on your local machine, but not yet applied to your working directory.

This command does not modify your local branch, but instead allows you to view the changes made to a branch in a remote repository. You can also use the `dolt status` command to see the difference between the remote branch and your local branch.

Once you have fetched the changes, you can use the `dolt merge` command to incorporate the changes into your local branch or the `dolt pull` command to fetch and merge changes in one step.

In summary, `dolt fetch` is used to update your local repository with changes from a remote Dolt database without modifying your local branch's code.
