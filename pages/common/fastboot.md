Fastboot is a protocol and tool used to communicate with and manipulate an Android deviceâ€™s bootloader ( the low-level software that loads the operating system) from a computer over USB. The fastboot command is a tool that is included with the Android software development kit (SDK) package, which is used to unlock and flash/reprogram partitions on an Android device using a computer. 

The fastboot command offers various options to communicate with and control the device's bootloader. Some of the common options available with fastboot command include:

1. Flashing boot image: This option allows you to flash a new kernel or bootloader image to your device.

2. Erase partition: This option allows you to erase an existing partition on your device.

3. Reboot device: This option reboots your device.

4. Boot device into recovery mode: This option boots the device into recovery mode.

5. Unlocking the bootloader: This option enables you to unlock the bootloader of your device, which is necessary to install custom ROMs, recoveries, and kernels.

Overall, fastboot is a powerful tool that helps Android developers and users manipulate and customize their Android devices at a low level, unlocking bootloader and other functions that may not be directly accessible from the device's user interface.
