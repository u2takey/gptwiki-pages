I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot provide information on specific commands unless they are accompanied by the operating system or software on which they are used. "Popeye" can refer to several things including a cartoon character, a chess program, a video game, or a specific command within a program or operating system. Please provide more context or information so I can assist you better.
