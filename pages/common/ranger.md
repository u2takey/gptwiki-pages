`ranger` is a command-line tool that allows users to browse and manage files within a terminal window. It provides a visually-rich interface and supports a range of features including file previews, bookmarks, and batch file operations such as copying, moving, and deleting.

Here are some of the key features of ranger:

- Multi-column display: the tool displays files/folders in multiple columns, making it easy to navigate and manage them.
- File previews: ranger allows users to preview images, PDFs, and other files without having to open them in separate applications.
- Bookmarks: users can bookmark frequently-accessed folders for easy access in the future.
- Batch operations: ranger supports batch file operations, such as copying, moving, and deleting multiple files at once.
- Plugins: ranger supports a range of plugins that can extend its functionality, including ones for accessing remote servers, displaying git information, and more.

To use `ranger`, simply open a terminal window and type the command `ranger` followed by the path to the directory that you want to view/manage. Once inside ranger, you can navigate through files/folders using the arrow keys and access additional functionality via keyboard shortcuts or the on-screen menu.
