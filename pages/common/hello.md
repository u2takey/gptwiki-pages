As an AI language model, I do not have context on the environment or programming language in which "hello" is being used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific explanation of the command "hello". 

In general, "hello" is a common greeting or salutation used in everyday conversation. It is not a command in and of itself, but rather an expression of acknowledgement or friendly communication. 

In a programming context, "hello" may be used in different ways depending on the language and syntax. For example, in a Unix or Linux command line interface, entering "hello" would likely result in an error as it is not a recognized command. In some programming languages, "hello" may be used as a string variable or object. In others, it may have a specific function or method associated with it.
