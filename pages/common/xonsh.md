`xonsh` is a Python-based shell language and command prompt. It is designed to be both a shell and a full Python interpreter, allowing for the execution of Python commands and scripts directly from the command line. 

The xonsh command launches an interactive shell with the xonsh syntax and provides access to the full range of Python libraries and modules. Xonsh supports many features found in other shells, such as tab completion, command history, and shell variables, as well as several unique features, such as the ability to use Python expressions in command lines.

When you run `xonsh`, you will get a terminal window where you will see a prompt where you can type in commands. Like other command line interpreters or shells, xonsh allows you to navigate your file system, launch applications, and control system processes. Additionally, you can execute Python code directly in the shell prompt, import Python libraries on the fly, and use xonsh's unique syntax to customize your shell experience. 

Overall, the xonsh command opens an interactive environment that provides users with a powerful combination of shell and Python capabilities, making it a versatile tool for scripting, automation, and more.
