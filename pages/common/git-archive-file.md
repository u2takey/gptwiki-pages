The `git archive-file` command is a way to create a tar or zip archive of a Git repository without including the Git metadata. This command is useful when you want to send or distribute a copy of a repository to someone who doesn't need access to the Git history or metadata.

Here is the breakdown of the command:

`git archive-file <path-to-archive> <commit>`

- `<path-to-archive>`: The path and filename for the archive you want to create. This file will have a `.tar` or `.zip` extension depending on the format you choose.
- `<commit>`: The Git commit that you want to archive. This can be a branch, tag or specific commit hash.

Additionally, you can specify a few additional options:

- `--format=<format>`: The format of the archive. `tar` and `zip` are popular options.
- `--prefix=<prefix>`: This option allows you to specify a prefix for the files in your archive. For example, if you specify `--prefix=my-project/`, all files will be stored in a directory called `my-project/` within the archive.
- `--verbose`: This option will print the files being added to the archive while it is being created.
- `--worktree-attributes`: This option will make sure the `.gitattributes` file in the working tree is used instead of the one in the Git directory. This is important if you have custom attributes set that are needed to properly build your project.

Overall, the `git archive-file` command is a useful way to create a portable copy of your Git repository that can be shared with others who do not need access to the Git metadata.
