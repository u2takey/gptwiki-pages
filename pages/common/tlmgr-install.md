tlmgr stands for TeX Live Manager, which is a command-line tool used to manage TeX Live installation. 

The command "tlmgr install" is used to install packages or updates. 

When executed, tlmgr searches for the specified package in the TeX Live repository and downloads it along with its dependencies. It then installs the package on the local machine. 

For example, if you want to install the package "xcolor", you can run the command "tlmgr install xcolor". This will download, install, and configure the xcolor package on your TeX Live distribution. 

It's important to note that the tlmgr command should be executed with administrative privileges, especially when installing packages system-wide. 

Overall, tlmgr install is a convenient way to manage TeX Live packages and keep your TeX environment up-to-date with the latest features and bug fixes.
