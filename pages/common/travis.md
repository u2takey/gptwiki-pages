Travis is a command line tool for interacting with the Travis CI service, which is a continuous integration and deployment platform for software development. The Travis command line tool allows developers to manage their Travis CI jobs and build configurations from their local command line interface.

The Travis command has several subcommands that can be used for various tasks. Some of the commonly used subcommands include:

- `travis login`: This command is used to authenticate the user with Travis CI service. It prompts the user to enter their GitHub username and password for authentication.
- `travis init`: This command is used to initialize a new Travis CI configuration file for the project. It generates a basic `.travis.yml` file in the project root directory, which can be further customized to define the build and deployment process for the project.
- `travis lint`: This command is used to validate the `.travis.yml` file syntax and checks for any errors or warnings.
- `travis branches`: This command is used to list all the branches for the project that are currently being built on Travis CI.
- `travis enable`: This command is used to enable Travis CI service for the project if it is disabled.
- `travis logs`: This command is used to view the build logs for the last build of the project.

These are just a few examples of the many subcommands that are available with the Travis command. The command can be used to manage various aspects of the Travis CI service from the comfort of the command line.
