The `sum` command is a built-in command in Linux that is used to calculate and display the total sum of a set of numbers. It is mainly used in combination with other commands and utilities, such as `awk`, `grep`, and `sort`.

The syntax of the `sum` command is as follows:

```
sum [file(s)]
```

Here, `file(s)` is an optional list of one or more files that contain the numbers to be summed. If no files are specified, the `sum` command reads input from the standard input (usually the keyboard).

When the command is executed, it reads the input line by line and calculates the sum of all the numbers in each line. It then displays the total sum, followed by the number of bytes and blocks in the input.

For example, if you have a file `numbers.txt` with the following content:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

You can calculate the sum of all the numbers in the file using the `sum` command:

```
$ sum numbers.txt
45 9 3
```

In this output, `45` is the total sum of all the numbers in the file, `9` is the number of bytes in the file, and `3` is the number of blocks in the file.

Overall, the `sum` command is a simple yet useful tool for quickly calculating the total sum of a set of numbers in Linux.

- Compute a checksum with BSD-compatible algorithm and 1024-byte blocks:

`sum {{path/to/file}}`

- Compute a checksum with System V-compatible algorithm and 512-byte blocks:

`sum --sysv {{path/to/file}}`
