"git svn" is a command used to interact with a Subversion repository using Git. It allows users to use Git as a client for Subversion. The command acts as a bridge between Git and SVN, allowing users to interact with the SVN repository using Git.

Here is an overview of the "git svn" command's sub-commands:

1. Clone - This sub-command is used to clone a Subversion repository to Git. Running the command "git svn clone" will download the entire SVN repository and convert it to a Git repository.

2. Init - This sub-command initializes a Git repository so it can be used with a Subversion repository. Running the command "git svn init" will configure the Git repository to connect to the SVN repository.

3. Fetch - This sub-command is used to obtain the latest changes from the SVN repository into Git. Running the command "git svn fetch" will download all the latest changes from the SVN repository.

4. Rebase - This sub-command is used to rebase the Git repository onto the latest version of the SVN repository. Running the command "git svn rebase" will replay all changes from the SVN repository onto the local Git repository.

5. Dcommit - This sub-command is used to commit changes from the Git repository to the SVN repository. Running the command "git svn dcommit" will push local Git repository changes to the SVN repository.

Overall, "git svn" is a useful command for those who prefer Git but still need to work with a Subversion repository.
