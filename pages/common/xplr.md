I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your system or its specific configuration. Therefore, I can not explain in detail the command "xplr" without more context. 

However, "xplr" can refer to a command-line file explorer tool called "xplr." xplr is written in Rust and can be used to navigate directories, view and edit files, manage bookmarks, and perform many other file-related tasks in the terminal. To use xplr, you would need to install it on your system (depending on your OS, this could be done through a package manager or manual installation) and run the "xplr" command in your terminal. Running the "xplr" command brings up the interactive interface for the file explorer, where you can use various commands and keybindings to navigate, select, and manipulate files and directories.
