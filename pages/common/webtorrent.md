WebTorrent is a command line program that allows users to stream torrents in their web browser. It is based on the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing protocol and enables users to decentralize media distribution through a P2P network. 

The WebTorrent command can be used in a number of ways, including:

- Creating a new WebTorrent swarm: Users can start a new swarm by specifying a file or directory, which WebTorrent will then create a new torrent file for. This torrent file can be shared with others, who can then join the swarm and download the file.
- Joining an existing WebTorrent swarm: Users can also join existing swarms by specifying the magnet link or .torrent file of the swarm they want to join. WebTorrent will then connect to other members of the swarm and begin downloading and sharing data.
- Streaming torrents in the browser: Once a user has joined a WebTorrent swarm, they can stream the contents of the torrent in their web browser. This can be done by using the WebTorrent command to create a server that serves the contents of the torrent over HTTP, which can then be accessed by the user's web browser.

In summary, the WebTorrent command allows users to create and join torrent swarms, as well as stream torrent content in their web browser. It provides a decentralized way to distribute large files and media, and can be useful for sharing files privately or for distributing content in a more scalable, cost-effective way.
