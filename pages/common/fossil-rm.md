# fossil rm 
## chatgpt 
The fossil rm command is used in Fossil version control system to remove one or more files or directories from the repository's working directory and versioned file history. 

The basic syntax for the command is `fossil rm FILENAME...`, where `FILENAME` refers to the name of the file or directory that is to be removed. Multiple files and directories can be specified by separating them with a space.

When the `fossil rm` command is executed, the specified files or directories are removed from the working directory and any versioned history is updated to reflect the removal. 

However, it's important to note that the removed files or directories are not actually deleted from the local system, but rather marked as "deleted" or "missing" within the repository. They can be restored at any time using the `fossil revert DELETED-FILES...` command. 

Additionally, the `fossil rm` command can also be used with several options to modify its behavior. For example, the `-f|--force` option can be used to forcefully remove files and directories, even those that have local modifications. Likewise, the `-n|--dry-run` option can be used to simulate what would happen if the command were executed without actually making any changes.
