Varnishlog is a command-line tool used to display logs of activities happening in Varnish Cache, a popular HTTP accelerator. 

When the command “varnishlog” is executed, it triggers the Varnish Cache logs to start displaying in the terminal or console window. These logs can provide critical information on server requests and client activities, including request headers and backend responses, cache hits and misses, and more.

The information provided by varnishlog is essential to maintaining high levels of server performance, troubleshooting issues as they arise, and gaining insight into the behavior of any web application. The user can select various options and filters to customize log output, including the breadth of information displayed and the time frame of the logs analyzed.

Overall, the varnishlog command is an essential tool for server administration and content delivery network (CDN) optimization. It provides detailed logs to help administrators monitor the activities occurring in their Varnish cache, improve website speed for users, and resolve any application issues that arise.
