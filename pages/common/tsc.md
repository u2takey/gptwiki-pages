The `tsc` command is used to compile TypeScript code into JavaScript code. It stands for "TypeScript Compiler" and is part of the TypeScript programming language.

Here's how the command works:

1. You first need to install TypeScript on your machine using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the command:

   ```
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

   This installs the TypeScript compiler globally on your machine, making it available in the command line.

2. Once TypeScript is installed, navigate to the directory where your TypeScript code is saved using the `cd` command.

3. Run the `tsc` command followed by the name of the TypeScript file you want to compile. For example, if your TypeScript code is saved in a file called `app.ts`, you would run:

   ```
   tsc app.ts
   ```

4. The `tsc` command will then compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript code, and create a new file with the same name as your TypeScript file but with a `.js` extension. In our example, it would create a new file called `app.js`.

5. You can then run the compiled JavaScript code using the node.js runtime environment by running the command:

   ```
   node app.js
   ```

   This will execute the compiled JavaScript code generated by the `tsc` command.

In summary, the `tsc` command is used to compile TypeScript code into JavaScript code, which can then be executed using node.js or any other JavaScript runtime environment.

- Compile a TypeScript file `foobar.ts` into a JavaScript file `foobar.js`:

`tsc {{foobar.ts}}`

- Compile a TypeScript file into JavaScript using a specific target syntax (default is `ES3`):

`tsc --target {{ES5|ES2015|ES2016|ES2017|ES2018|ESNEXT}} {{foobar.ts}}`

- Compile a TypeScript file into a JavaScript file with a custom name:

`tsc --outFile {{output.js}} {{input.ts}}`

- Compile all `.ts` files of a TypeScript project defined in a `tsconfig.json` file:

`tsc --build {{tsconfig.json}}`

- Run the compiler using command-line options and arguments fetched from a text file:

`tsc @{{args.txt}}`

- Type-check multiple JavaScript files, and output only the errors:

`tsc --allowJs --checkJs --noEmit {{src/**/*.js}}`
