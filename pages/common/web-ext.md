Web-ext is a command-line tool for developing, testing, and packaging web extension projects. Web extensions are small software programs that add functionality to web browsers. They can modify web pages, provide new user interface elements, and enhance security and privacy.

The web-ext command has several subcommands that allow developers to perform various tasks related to web extension development. Here are some commonly used subcommands:

- `run`: Starts a development server and launches Firefox with the web extension installed. This allows developers to test their changes in a real browser environment.
- `build`: Packages the web extension into a distributable format, such as a zip file, for submission to an extension store like Mozilla Add-ons or Chrome Web Store.
- `sign`: Digitally signs the web extension using Mozilla's signing service. This is required for publishing the extension on Mozilla Add-ons
- `lint`: Checks the code for potential errors and style violations, helping developers ensure that their code is consistent and error-free.

To use web-ext, developers must install it using npm, the Node Package Manager. Once installed, they can run the web-ext command from the command line with the desired subcommand and options. The tool provides detailed feedback on the command's output, allowing developers to quickly identify and correct any issues with their web extension.
