# clj 
## chatgpt 
"clj" is a command used to run the Clojure REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop). 

REPL is a simple interactive command-line interface that enables a user to enter commands one at a time and receive immediate feedback. Clojure is a programming language that is designed to be concise, dynamic, and scalable, and is built on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 

The "clj" command launches the Clojure REPL, allowing you to start coding and experimenting with the language. Once the REPL is started, you can type in Clojure expressions which are then evaluated and the results are displayed in the terminal window. 

Overall, "clj" is a basic but powerful tool used by Clojure developers for quick and iterative development, as well as for testing and debugging code.

- Start a REPL (interactive shell):

`clj`

- Execute a function:

`clj -X {{namespace/function_name}}`

- Run the main function of a specified namespace:

`clj -M -m {{namespace}} {{args}}`

- Prepare a project by resolving dependencies, downloading libraries, and making / caching classpaths:

`clj -P`

- Start an nREPL server with the CIDER middleware:

`clj -Sdeps '{:deps {nrepl {:mvn/version "0.7.0"} cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.25.2"}}}' -m nrepl.cmdline --middleware '["cider.nrepl/cider-middleware"]' --interactive`

- Start a REPL for ClojureScript and open a web browser:

`clj -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.758"}}}' --main cljs.main --repl`
