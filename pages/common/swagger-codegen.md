Swagger-codegen is a command-line tool that generates client libraries, server stubs, API documentation, and other artifacts based on an OpenAPI or Swagger specification. 

The Swagger-codegen command is used to generate these artifacts. The basic syntax of the command is as follows:

swagger-codegen <command> [options]

The available commands are:

generate: This is the main command that generates code based on the input specification.

help: This command displays the help information of the tool.

config-help: This command displays the help information for the configuration file.

meta: This command displays metadata for a specific language or library.

validate: This command validates an input specification.

There are many options available with each command, which allow you to customize the generated code. Some common options are:

-i/--input-spec: This option is used to specify the path to the input specification file.

-o/--output: This option is used to specify the output directory for the generated code.

-l/--lang: This option is used to specify the programming language for the generated code.

The Swagger-codegen tool supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, Python, Ruby, Scala, and Node.js. The tool has been widely used in the API development community to simplify the process of creating clients and servers for RESTful APIs.
