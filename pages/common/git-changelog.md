I'm sorry, but there is no `git changelog` command in Git. However, there are ways to generate a changelog using Git. Below are some options:

1. Use a third-party tool like `git-changelog`: `git-changelog` is a Python-based command-line tool that generates a changelog file based on Git commit messages. To use it, you need to install it first using `pip install git-changelog`. Then, you can generate a changelog file using the `git-changelog` command in your Git repository.

2. Manually generate a changelog: You can manually generate a changelog by going through the Git commit messages and categorizing them into different sections (e.g., bug fixes, new features, enhancements, etc.). You can then create a Markdown file and write the changelog in it.

3. Use a Git hosting service: Some Git hosting services like GitHub and GitLab provide a built-in changelog generation feature. For example, in GitHub, you can go to the Releases page for your repository and choose "Generate changelog" to create a changelog based on the commits in your repository.

- Update existing file or create a new `History.md` file with the commit messages since the latest Git tag:

`git changelog`

- List commits from the current version:

`git changelog --list`

- List a range of commits from the tag named `2.1.0` to now:

`git changelog --list --start-tag {{2.1.0}}`

- List pretty formatted range of commits between the tag `0.5.0` and the tag `1.0.0`:

`git changelog --start-tag {{0.5.0}} --final-tag {{1.0.0}}`

- List pretty formatted range of commits between the commit `0b97430` and the tag `1.0.0`:

`git changelog --start-commit {{0b97430}} --final-tag {{1.0.0}}`

- Specify `CHANGELOG.md` as the output file:

`git changelog {{CHANGELOG.md}}`

- Replace contents of current changelog file entirely:

`git changelog --prune-old`
