## chatgpt 
npx is a command-line tool that comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager) version 5.2 and higher. The npx command is used to execute npm packages without having to install them globally on your computer. 

When you run the npx command followed by a package name, it checks whether the package is installed on your system. If the package is not installed, npx will download the latest version of the package and execute it in memory. 

For example, to run the "create-react-app" package, normally you would have to install it globally on your system using the command: 

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

But with npx, you can simply run:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```
This command downloads the latest version of "create-react-app" package and creates a new React project named "my-app" without having to install it globally on your system.

The primary advantage of npx is that it allows you to quickly and easily run one-off commands from packages that you do not need installed globally or in your project's dependencies. This can help you avoid potential dependency issues and save disk space on your system.

> Execute binaries from `npm` packages.
> More information: <https://github.com/npm/npx>.

- Execute the binary from a given npm module:

`npx {{module_name}} {{command_arguments}}`

- In case a package has multiple binaries, specify the package name along with the binary:

`npx --package {{package_name}} {{module_name}}`

- Run a command if it exists in the current path or in `node_modules/.bin`:

`npx --no-install {{command}} {{command_arguments}}`

- Execute the binary from a given npm module suppressing any output from `npx` itself:

`npx --quiet {{module_name}} {{command_arguments}}`

- Display help:

`npx --help`
