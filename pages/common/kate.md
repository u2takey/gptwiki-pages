Kate is a text editor for Linux operating systems. When used as a command, it opens the Kate application, which can be used to create, edit, and save text files. 

Upon executing the "kate" command in the terminal or command line interface, the user interface of Kate will open requesting the user to create a new file or open an existing one. Once the user creates or opens an existing file, they can save their changes by pressing "Save" or "Save As" in the File menu. Kate allows users to edit text using a variety of features including syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and code snippets. 

Additionally, Kate supports the use of plug-ins which can extend it functionality to allow for advanced features such as version control integration, project management, and advanced text editing. Overall, the kate command is used to launch the Kate application and start editing text files in a Linux environment.
