`http-server` is a command used in the terminal to start a simple, zero-configuration HTTP server.

Here's how it works:

1. Install Node.js: Before using the `http-server` command, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official Node.js website.

2. Open the terminal: Once you have Node.js installed, open the terminal on your machine.

3. Navigate to your project directory: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory that you want to serve.

4. Enter the `http-server` command: Once you are in your project directory, type `http-server` in the terminal and press the Enter key.

5. The server will start: The `http-server` command will start a local web server and display a message in the terminal that includes the address of the server (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8080` or `http://localhost:8080`).

6. View your project: Open your web browser and paste the server address into the address bar. You should be able to see your project and interact with it just as you would on a live website.

That's how the `http-server` command works. It's a quick and easy way to serve your static files locally during development.
