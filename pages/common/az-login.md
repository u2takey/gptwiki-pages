The "az login" command is used to authenticate and sign in to an Azure account or environment. This command is part of the Azure CLI (Command-Line Interface) that allows users to manage Azure resources from the command line or terminal. 

When you run the "az login" command, you will be prompted to enter your credentials such as the email address and password associated with your Azure account. After entering your credentials, Azure will verify your identity and once your identity is authenticated, it will create a security token that will allow you to access Azure resources through the command-line interface.

Once you are logged in, you can use other Azure CLI commands to manage Azure resources, such as creating and deploying virtual machines, creating and managing databases, and monitoring Azure services. 

It is important to note that the "az login" command is a prerequisite for using any other Azure CLI commands as they require you to be authenticated and authorized to perform actions on Azure resources. 

Overall, the "az login" command provides a simple and efficient way to authenticate yourself with Azure and launch a secure CLI session.
