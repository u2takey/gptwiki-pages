The `apropos` command is a Linux/Unix command that is used to search the system's manual page database for a specific word or a phrase. The command quickly finds and displays a list of manual pages that contain the word or phrase searched for. This command is particularly useful when a user is not sure about the exact name of a command or its function.

The `apropos` command comes bundled with the `man-db` package and is usually pre-installed on most Linux and Unix systems. To use `apropos`, simply type "apropos" followed by the keyword or phrase you are looking for. For example, `apropos network` will return a list of manual pages related to the network topic.

The output will include the name of the command, its short description, and the section to which it belongs. In Linux/Unix, the man pages are organized in multiple sections, and each section has unique content.

A section breakdown:

- Section 1: User commands
- Section 2: System calls
- Section 3: Library functions, covering most of the C library, including the standard math library.
- Section 4: Special files (usually found in /dev)
- Section 5: File formats and conventions
- Section 6: Games and screensavers
- Section 7: Miscellaneous(macro packages, protocols, the et cetera)
- Section 8: System administration and privileged commands

By default, the `apropos` command searches for keywords in all the sections. However, you can specify the desired section using the "-s" option. For example, `apropos -s 1 network` to search for network-related commands in section 1.

Overall, `apropos` is an efficient command to quickly find relevant commands and functions in the system's manual page database.
