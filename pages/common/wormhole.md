As an AI language model, I don't have direct access to your operating system or terminal, but I can provide a general explanation of the wormhole command. 

Wormhole is a command-line utility used to securely send files and messages from one computer to another via a relay server. It creates a kind of temporary, encrypted tunnel between two devices, allowing them to exchange information without either device knowing the other's IP address. This is useful for transferring files between two computers securely and peer-to-peer without involving any third-party software.

Here's an example use-case: 

Suppose you wanted to send a large file to a friend, but you didn't want to use email or a cloud service that keeps a copy of the file. With wormhole, you could generate a one-time-use "wormhole code" that your friend could use to retrieve the file. 

To use wormhole, you would first install it on your machine using your operating system's package manager (e.g. Homebrew on macOS, apt-get on Ubuntu). Once installed, you would navigate to the directory where the file you want to send is located and run the command `wormhole send file.txt`. This would generate a code, which you could give to your friend via email, chat, or any other messaging app. 

Your friend, in turn, would install wormhole on their computer and run the command `wormhole receive` followed by the code you provided. This would initiate the secure transfer of the file from your computer to theirs. 

Overall, wormhole is a handy tool for securely transferring files between two computers, especially when you don't want to use a third-party service or trust a cloud provider with your data.
