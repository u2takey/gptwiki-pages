The `hostid` command is a Linux/Unix utility command that is used to display the unique identifier (a 32-bit hexadecimal number) of the current computer or server. It retrieves the identifier from the "hostid" file located in the "/etc" directory.

When executed, the `hostid` command prints the hexadecimal identification number to the standard output. This identifier is unique to each machine, and it can be used for various purposes, such as software licensing, authentication, and identification of network nodes.

The `hostid` command is generally used by system administrators to identify a system for licensing and by developers for software registration purposes. The command can also be used to verify if the hardware configuration of the server has changed.

It is important to note that the `hostid` command does not modify or change the system's unique identification number. In other words, running the `hostid` command will not alter the hexadecimal number stored in the "hostid" file.

In summary, the `hostid` command is a simple tool that provides easy access to the unique identification number of a Linux/Unix system.
