# git request-pull 
## chatgpt 
The `git request-pull` command is used to generate a summary of pending changes that are ready to be pulled by a remote Git repository. It is typically used when a developer has made some changes to a repository and wants to request that the changes be integrated into another repository or branch.

The basic syntax of the `git request-pull` command is:

```
git request-pull start_branch end_branch [remote_repository]
```

Here, `start_branch` and `end_branch` represent the range of commits that are to be pulled, and `remote_repository` is the Git repository where the changes are to be pulled from.

The `git request-pull` command generates a summary of the changes in the following format:

```
The following changes since commit <commit ID>:

  <list of changes>

Please pull from <repository URL> <start_branch>:
```

The `<list of changes>` information includes details about the changes made in terms of added, deleted or modified files, and also includes commit messages.

The `git request-pull` command is useful for streamlining the process of requesting that changes be pulled into a repository or branch, as it provides a clear and concise summary of the changes that are to be pulled.
