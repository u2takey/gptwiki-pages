The `scan-build` command is a utility tool provided by the Clang Static Analyzer that performs static analysis of C, C++, and Objective-C code for security vulnerabilities and code quality issues. 

When invoked, `scan-build` creates a build database of the code it analyzes, and then builds the code using the Clang compiler. As the code is being compiled, it analyzes the code for potential issues such as memory leaks, buffer overflow, null pointer dereferences, and more.

Some things that `scan-build` checks for include:
- Use after free
- Division by zero
- Memory leaks
- Null-termination errors
- Dereferencing a null pointer
- Out-of-bounds array index
- Heap buffer overflow
- Integer overflow

After the analysis is complete, `scan-build` generates a report containing the issues it detected. The report is typically viewed in a web browser and provides a detailed analysis of the code and the issues that were detected.

By running `scan-build` regularly during the development process, developers can catch potential issues early on and address them before they become problems.
