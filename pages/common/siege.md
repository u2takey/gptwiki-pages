Siege is a popular open-source command-line utility that allows users to stress test their web applications by simulating real-world traffic load. It can be used to send multiple HTTP/HTTPS requests and evaluate the web server's performance under high traffic conditions. 

Here are a few important parameters that can be used with the siege command:

- -c or --concurrent: Specifies the number of concurrent users to simulate. For example, the command `siege -c10 http://example.com` will simulate 10 concurrent users hitting the "example.com" server simultaneously.

- -r or --reps: Specifies the number of repetitions for the test. For example, the command `siege -c10 -r5 http://example.com` will simulate 10 concurrent users hitting the "example.com" server five times each.

- -t or --time: Specifies the duration of the test. For example, the command `siege -c10 -t2m http://example.com` will simulate 10 concurrent users hitting the "example.com" server for 2 minutes.

- -f or --file: Specifies the input file containing a list of URLs to test. For example, the command `siege -c10 -f urls.txt` will read the list of URLs from the "urls.txt" file and simulate 10 concurrent users hitting each URL.

- -d or --delay: Specifies the delay between consecutive requests in seconds. For example, the command `siege -c10 -t1m -d5 http://example.com` will simulate 10 concurrent users hitting the "example.com" server for 1 minute with a 5-second delay between each request.

Overall, the siege command is a powerful tool for load-testing web applications and identifying potential performance bottlenecks under high traffic conditions.

- Test a URL with default settings:

`siege {{https://example.com}}`

- Test a list of URLs:

`siege --file {{path/to/url_list.txt}}`

- Test list of URLs in a random order (Simulates internet traffic):

`siege --internet --file {{path/to/url_list.txt}}`

- Benchmark a list of URLs (without waiting between requests):

`siege --benchmark --file {{path/to/url_list.txt}}`

- Set the amount of concurrent connections:

`siege --concurrent={{50}} --file {{path/to/url_list.txt}}`

- Set how long for the siege to run for:

`siege --time={{30s}} --file {{path/to/url_list.txt}}`
