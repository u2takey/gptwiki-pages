Gnuplot is a command-line program that is used to create 2D and 3D plots of data. It is a powerful and flexible tool that can be used for a wide range of applications from simple graphing to complex scientific plotting. 

When you launch the gnuplot program, you will typically see a prompt that looks like:

gnuplot>

This is the place where you can enter commands to the gnuplot interpreter. The most basic command is to plot some data. For example, you can enter:

gnuplot> plot "data.txt"

This command will read the data from a file called "data.txt" and create a 2D plot of the data. By default, gnuplot will use the first column of data as the x-axis and the second column as the y-axis. 

You can customize the appearance of the plot in many ways. For example, you can add a title and labels for the axes:

gnuplot> set title "My Plot"
gnuplot> set xlabel "X Axis"
gnuplot> set ylabel "Y Axis"

You can also change the type of plot, add a legend, and change the line style:

gnuplot> plot "data.txt" with points title "Data Points"
gnuplot> set key outside
gnuplot> set style line 1 lw 3 lc rgb "red"
gnuplot> set style line 2 lw 2 lc rgb "blue"
gnuplot> plot "data.txt" using 1:2 with lines linestyle 1 title "Line 1",\
              "" using 1:3 with lines linestyle 2 title "Line 2"

This example plots two lines from the same data file, assigns different line styles to each line, and adds a legend to identify the lines. 

Overall, gnuplot is a powerful and flexible tool for creating high-quality plots and graphs. While the syntax may take some getting used to, once you become familiar with the basic commands, you will be able to create complex plots with ease.

- Start the interactive graph plotting shell:

`gnuplot`

- Plot the graph for the specified graph definition file:

`gnuplot {{path/to/definition.plt}}`

- Set the output format by executing a command before loading the definition file:

`gnuplot -e "{{set output "path/to/filename.png" size 1024,768}}" {{path/to/definition.plt}}`

- Persist the graph plot preview window after gnuplot exits:

`gnuplot --persist {{path/to/definition.plt}}`
