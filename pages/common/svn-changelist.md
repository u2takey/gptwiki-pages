# svn changelist 
## chatgpt 
The 'svn changelist' command is a Subversion command that is used to manage changes to a specific set of files. When working with large projects, there can be a lot of files that are modified but not ready to be committed to the repository. This command is used to group those modified files into a changelist so that they can be easily tracked and managed.

The syntax for the command is as follows:

svn changelist CHANGELISTNAME [PATH...]

Here, 'CHANGELISTNAME' is the name of the changelist that you want to create, and 'PATH' is the path to the file(s) that you want to add to the changelist. If you don't specify a path, the command will assume that you want to add all modified files to the changelist.

Once you've created a changelist, you can use other commands like 'svn status' and 'svn commit' to interact with the files in that changelist. For example, you might use 'svn status --changelist CHANGELISTNAME' to see the status of all files in that changelist, or 'svn commit --changelist CHANGELISTNAME' to commit all changes in that changelist to the repository.

Overall, the 'svn changelist' command is a useful tool for managing changes to specific sets of files within a larger project, and can help keep things organized and easily trackable.

- Add files to a changelist, creating the changelist if it does not exist:

`svn changelist {{changelist_name}} {{path/to/file1}} {{path/to/file2}}`

- Remove files from a changelist:

`svn changelist --remove {{path/to/file1}} {{path/to/file2}}`

- Remove the whole changelist at once:

`svn changelist --remove --recursive --changelist {{changelist_name}} .`

- Add the contents of a space-separated list of directories to a changelist:

`svn changelist --recursive {{changelist_name}} {{path/to/directory1}} {{path/to/directory2}}`

- Commit a changelist:

`svn commit --changelist {{changelist_name}}`
