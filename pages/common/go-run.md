# go run 
## chatgpt 
"Go run" is a command used in Go Programming Language. 

The "go" command is a tool for managing Go source code. It can compile, test, and install packages of Go source code. It is also used to manage dependencies and versioning.

The "run" subcommand is used to compile and run a Go program in a single step. It takes a main Go source file as input, compiles it into an executable, and then runs the executable.

To use the "go run" command, you must first navigate to the directory containing the Go source code that you want to run. You can then run the "go run" command followed by the name of the main Go source file.

For example, if you have a main.go file in your current directory, you can run it using the following command:

go run main.go

This command will compile and run the main.go file in a single step. If there are any errors in the code, the "go run" command will display them in the console.

The "go run" command is a convenient way to quickly compile and run small Go programs without having to manually compile and execute the resulting binary. However, for larger projects, it may be better to use the "go build" command to create a binary file that can be run separately.
