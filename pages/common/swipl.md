The command "swipl" is used to run the SWI-Prolog interpreter. 

SWI-Prolog is a Prolog programming language implementation and development environment. When you run the "swipl" command, it opens the SWI-Prolog interpreter in the command-line interface. This enables you to enter Prolog commands and run Prolog programs.

Once the interpreter is open, you can enter Prolog commands and evaluate them one by one. SWI-Prolog provides a variety of built-in commands that can be used to perform various operations like arithmetic calculations, string manipulation, defining rules and facts, querying facts, and more.

Overall, the "swipl" command allows you to work with Prolog programs using the SWI-Prolog interpreter in a command-line environment.
