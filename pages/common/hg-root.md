The `hg root` command is a command used in the Mercurial version control system to display the root directory of the current Mercurial repository.

When you run the `hg root` command, the Mercurial system searches for the `.hg` directory which contains the repository data, associated metadata, and other configuration files. Once it finds the `.hg` directory, it returns the path to the root directory of the repository.

Here's an example of how to use the `hg root` command in a terminal window:

```
$ cd /path/to/hg/repo
$ hg root
/path/to/hg/repo
```

In the example above, the user changes their current working directory to the root of the Mercurial repository, then types `hg root` to display the root directory path.

The `hg root` command is useful when you need to know the root directory of the repository to perform other Mercurial commands, or to perform operations on the repository files outside of Mercurial.
