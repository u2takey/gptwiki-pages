# gitlint 
## chatgpt 
gitlint is a command-line tool that provides automated linting of Git commit messages. Gitlint checks the commit messages against a set of predefined rules and provides detailed feedback on how to improve the message.

When you run the `gitlint` command, it analyzes the latest commit message in your Git repository and provides feedback on how well it adheres to the rules. If the commit message violates any rules or best practices, gitlint will provide detailed feedback on how to improve it.

Gitlint has several built-in rules and configuration options that you can modify to suit your specific needs. You can run `gitlint` with various parameters to customize the behavior of the tool, such as specifying a different configuration file or filtering the output to only show certain types of violations.

In summary, `gitlint` is a command that helps enforce good commit message practices, thus improving the quality and readability of your codebase over time.
