The PProf command is a profiling tool used to analyze and visualize profiling data generated by Go programs. 

When a Go program is executed with profiling enabled, the runtime collects information about the program's behavior during execution. This information is saved as a profiling output file, which can be viewed and analyzed using the PProf command.

Some common use cases for the PProf command include identifying bottlenecks in a program's performance, understanding how a program is using system resources like CPU and memory, and optimizing code to improve performance.

To use the PProf command, you must first generate a profiling output file by running your Go program with the appropriate command-line flags. Once you have a profiling output file, you can open it with the PProf command and use various subcommands to analyze and visualize the data.

For example, you can use the 'list' subcommand to show the source code for a specific function or method in your program, and the 'top' subcommand to display a list of the most time-consuming functions or methods in your program.

Overall, the PProf command is a powerful tool for analyzing performance data and optimizing Go programs for better performance.

- Generate a text report from a specific profiling file, on fibbo binary:

`pprof -top {{./fibbo}} {{./fibbo-profile.pb.gz}}`

- Generate a graph and open it on a web browser:

`pprof -svg {{./fibbo}} {{./fibbo-profile.pb.gz}}`

- Run pprof in interactive mode to be able to manually launch `pprof` on a file:

`pprof {{./fibbo}} {{./fibbo-profile.pb.gz}}`

- Run a web server that serves a web interface on top of `pprof`:

`pprof -http={{localhost:8080}} {{./fibbo}} {{./fibbo-profile.pb.gz}}`

- Fetch a profile from an HTTP server and generate a report:

`pprof {{http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof}}`
