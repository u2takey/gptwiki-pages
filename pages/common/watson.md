As an AI language model, I can't execute commands, but I can explain to you what Watson is. 

Watson is a question-answering computer system developed by IBM. It is designed to be able to understand natural language and provide answers to questions posed in natural language. Watson is built using a combination of techniques including natural language processing, machine learning, and statistical analysis. It is named after the first CEO of IBM, Thomas J. Watson. Watson has been used in a variety of domains, including finance, healthcare, and education, and has been able to accomplish advanced tasks such as diagnosis, recommendation, and prediction. Watson has also been used in game shows, where it competed against human players and won, demonstrating the power of AI technology.
