`Sops` is a command line tool used for editing or managing encrypted files, primarily YAML or JSON, using SOPS plugin (Secrets OPerationS). It helps you to manage and store secrets in version control with minimal risk of exposing them.

The `sops` command supports various subcommands to work with encrypted files. Some of the commonly used subcommands are:

1. `sops edit`: This command opens the encrypted file in your default system editor, where you can edit and save changes. It works in real-time and automatically decrypts and encrypts the file using the specified encryption method.

2. `sops encrypt`: This command encrypts an unencrypted file with a specific encryption method that you choose. You can also specify the encryption key and output file location.

3. `sops view`: This command allows you to view the decrypted content of an encrypted file in your terminal.

4. `sops recrypt`: This command changes the key used to encrypt a file.

5. `sops apply`: This command applies changes that you made to an encrypted file and overwrites the original file.

Overall, `sops` is a useful tool for developers who want to secure and store their sensitive data in version control.

- Encrypt a file:

`sops -e {{path/to/myfile.json}} > {{path/to/myfile.enc.json}}`

- Decrypt a file to the standard output:

`sops -d {{path/to/myfile.enc.json}}`

- Rotate data keys for a sops file:

`sops -r {{path/to/myfile.enc.yaml}}`

- Change the extension of the file once encrypted:

`sops -d --input-type json {{path/to/myfile.enc.json}}`

- Extract keys by naming them, and array elements by numbering them:

`sops -d --extract '["an_array"][1]' {{path/to/myfile.enc.json}}`

- Show the difference between two sops files:

`diff <(sops -d {{path/to/secret1.enc.yaml}}) <(sops -d {{path/to/secret2.enc.yaml}})`
