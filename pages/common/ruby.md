"ruby" is a command that is used to execute Ruby programs in a command-line interface or terminal. It is followed by the name of the Ruby file that needs to be executed.

When we type the "ruby" command followed by a space and the name of the Ruby file with the .rb extension, the command-line interface interprets it as a command to execute the program. The Ruby interpreter reads the code written in the file and executes it line by line.

For example:

```
ruby hello.rb
```

In this case, "hello.rb" is the file that contains the Ruby code. When we execute the above command, the Ruby program written in the "hello.rb" file is executed, and the output is displayed on the terminal.

The output can be anything depending on the code written in the Ruby program. The "ruby" command is an essential tool for running Ruby programs from a terminal or command prompt.
