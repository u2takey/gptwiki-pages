# git coauthor 
## chatgpt 
The command "git coauthor" is not a default or standard Git command. 

However, if you are referring to the "git-commit-co-authors" extension, the "git coauthor" command would include additional co-authors to a commit message.

Here's how to use it:

1. Install the "git-commit-co-authors" extension: 
   a. Clone the official repository from https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/git-commit
   b. Copy the "git-commit-co-authors.txt" file to your "contrib" directory
   c. Add an alias in your global Git configuration file to enable the "git-commit-co-authors" extension. Example: 

       git config --global alias.commit-co 'commit-co-authors -s'

2. Make sure you have an active Git repository and check out the branch you want to modify.

3. Run the "git coauthor" command followed by the name and email address of each additional co-author you want to add. Example:

    git coauthor "Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>" "John Smith <john.smith@example.com>"

4. The command will open your default text editor, where you can enter the commit message with the appended co-author information:

   Example:

   Original commit message: 
   "Add feature XYZ"

   Final commit message with co-authors:
   "Add feature XYZ

    Co-authored-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>
    Co-authored-by: John Smith <john.smith@example.com>"

5. Save and exit the editor to commit your changes.
