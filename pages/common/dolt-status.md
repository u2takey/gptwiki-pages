# dolt status 
## chatgpt 
The `dolt status` command is used to display the status of the current Dolt repository. It shows information about the changes that have been made to the repository, such as modifications to existing data, new data added, staged changes, and untracked files.

When you run the `dolt status` command, Dolt examines the working directory and compares it to the repository's state. It then outputs information about any changes that have been made, in the following format:

- Files that have been modified but not yet staged: These are the changes that have been made to files that are tracked but haven't been committed yet. They are listed under the "Changes not staged for commit" heading.

- Staged changes: These are changes that have been added to the staging area using the `dolt add` command but haven't been committed yet. They are listed under the "Changes to be committed" heading.

- Untracked files: These are files that are not yet tracked by Dolt. They are listed under the "Untracked files" heading.

The `dolt status` command also includes additional information about the repository's state, such as the current branch, the number of commits ahead or behind the remote repository, and whether there are any merge conflicts that need to be resolved.

Overall, the `dolt status` command is a useful way to quickly check the status of your Dolt repository and ensure that everything is in order before committing changes.
