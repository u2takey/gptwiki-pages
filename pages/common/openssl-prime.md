The `openssl prime` command is a built-in command in the OpenSSL library that verifies whether a given number is a prime number or not. This command takes an integer as an argument and performs the Miller-Rabin probabilistic primality test on it.

The Miller-Rabin test is a probabilistic algorithm that checks whether a given number is prime or not. It works by repeating a random test for a certain number of times (by default, this is set to 64). If the number passes all the random tests, it is considered a prime number.

The `openssl prime` command is a useful tool when you need to verify whether a large number is a prime number or not. It can also be used for generating prime numbers by checking a range of numbers with the command and picking a number that passes all the tests.

Here's an example of using the command:

`openssl prime 65537`

In this example, the command is checking whether the number 65537 is a prime number or not. If the number is a prime number, the command will output "65537 is prime". If it is not a prime number, it will output "65537 is not prime".

It's important to note that the `openssl prime` command performs a probabilistic test, which means that there is a chance that it may falsely identify a composite number as prime. Therefore, it's recommended to use a deterministic test like the AKS primality test if you need to verify primality with 100% certainty.

- Generate a 2048bit prime number and display it in hexadecimal:

`openssl prime -generate -bits 2048 -hex`

- Check if a given number is prime:

`openssl prime {{number}}`
