The command "gtop" on Linux systems is a command-line system monitoring tool that displays real-time system resource usage statistics. When executed, gtop displays various system performance metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, swap usage, system load, and network usage. 

Gtop also displays an interactive process list, which shows the resource usage stats of individual processes at the top, followed by the system's overall resource usage stats below. 

Some of the benefits of using gtop include accessing real-time and accurate data on system health, diagnosing system performance issues, and quickly identifying which processes are consuming too many resources.

To install gtop, you can use the package manager that comes with your distribution. On Ubuntu and Debian-based systems, use the following command:

sudo apt-get install gtop 

Once installed, simply type "gtop" on the command line, and real-time system performance statistics will be displayed.
