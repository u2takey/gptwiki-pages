Makensis is a command-line tool used to create executable files from NSIS scripts. NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) is a free, open-source software that allows developers to create installers for their applications.

When the "makensis" command is entered in the command prompt or terminal, the tool begins executing and goes through the following steps:

1. Parsing the NSIS script: Makensis reads the NSIS script provided as an argument and tries to parse it. If there are any errors in the script, the tool will display an error message and stop.

2. Compiling the script: If the script is valid, Makensis will then start compiling it. During the compilation process, Makensis generates an output file that contains the instructions and resources required for the installer.

3. Generating the final executable file: Once the compilation is complete, Makensis generates an executable file that contains the installer. This file can be distributed to users to install the application on their machines.

Overall, the "makensis" command is used to build and create executable installers for software applications using NSIS scripts.
