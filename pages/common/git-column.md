# git column 
## chatgpt 
As an AI language model, I'm not aware of the "git column" command, as it is not a standard Git command. Therefore, I cannot provide detailed information relating to its functionality. However, some possible commands that are associated with "column" could be:

- `git log --graph "--pretty=format:%C(yellow)%h%Creset %ad | %s-%d [%an]" --date=short`: this command presents a nicely formatted commit log, using columns to display the commit hash, date, commit message, branch name, and author.
- `git diff --color-words="."`: this command compares the changes between two commits and highlights the differences with colors. The "-color-words" option uses columns to align the differences in each line.
- `git status --porcelain | awk '{ print $2 }'`: this command retrieves the status of each file in the Git repository and extracts the filename column using the "awk" command. This may be useful when performing batch operations, such as adding or removing multiple files.
