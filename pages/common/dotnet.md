## chatgpt 
"dotnet" is a command-line tool and runtime environment used for building, running and managing .NET applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. It provides a unified development environment for building applications for different platforms by using the .NET platform. The dotnet command can be used for a variety of tasks related to .NET development, including:

1. Creating new projects: The dotnet new command creates new .NET projects using different templates such as Console Application, Class Library, Web Application, etc.

2. Building projects: The dotnet build command compiles the code and creates an output executable or library file.

3. Running projects: The dotnet run command runs the application by compiling and executing the code.

4. Publishing projects: The dotnet publish command compiles the code, packages it, and prepares it for deployment to a target environment.

5. Managing packages: The dotnet add package and dotnet remove package commands are used for adding and removing packages that provide added functionality to a .NET application.

Overall, the "dotnet" command is an essential tool for .NET developers to build, test, and deploy applications across multiple platforms.

- Initialize a new .NET project:

`dotnet new {{template_short_name}}`

- Restore NuGet packages:

`dotnet restore`

- Build and execute the .NET project in the current directory:

`dotnet run`

- Run a packaged dotnet application (only needs the runtime, the rest of the commands require the .NET Core SDK installed):

`dotnet {{path/to/application.dll}}`
