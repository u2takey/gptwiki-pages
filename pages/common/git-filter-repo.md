Git filter-repo is a command that is used to rewrite the Git history of a repository by applying various filters to it. It is a powerful tool that can be used for many purposes like cleaning up a repository, removing confidential or sensitive information, or splitting a repository into smaller ones.

The syntax of the git filter-repo command is:

```
git filter-repo [options] [--] [revision range or file]
```

Some of the most commonly used options with git filter-repo are:

- `--force`: This option is used to force the command to run even if it may cause data loss.
- `--invert-paths`: This option is used to invert the paths that are matched by the filters.
- `--path`: This option is used to specify the files or paths that should be filtered.
- `--replace-text`: This option is used to replace the specified text in the Git history of the repository.

When you run the git filter-repo command, it performs the following steps:

1. Read the history of the repository and create a new copy of it.
2. Apply the specified filters to the new copy of the repository.
3. Write the new Git history to the repository.

It is important to note that git filter-repo can modify the Git history of a repository, so it should be used with caution. It is recommended to make a backup copy of the repository before running this command.
