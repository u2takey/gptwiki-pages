recsel is not a standard command in Unix/Linux systems, so it is not possible to provide a detailed explanation.

However, based on some online sources, recsel is a utility used in the LibreOffice suite to select records in a database. It allows users to specify search criteria and filter records based on them. 

The basic syntax for using recsel is:

recsel <database file> <table> [options] [WHERE clause]

Here, <database file> is the path to the database file containing the table, and <table> is the name of the table to search. 

The WHERE clause is used to specify search criteria, such as "age > 30" or "name = 'John'". The options available with recsel may vary depending on the version of LibreOffice being used.

Once the search criteria have been specified, recsel will output the matching records in a specified format. The output can also be piped to other commands for further processing.

Overall, recsel is a useful tool for working with databases in the LibreOffice suite. However, it is not a widely used command outside of this context.

- Extract name and version field:

- Use "~" to match a string with a given regular expression:

`recsel -e "{{field_name}} ~ '{{regular_expression}}' {{data.rec}}"`

- Use a predicate to match a name and a version:

`recsel -e "name ~ '{{regular_expression}}' && version ~ '{{regular_expression}}'" {{data.rec}}`
