The `true` command is a shell built-in command that does nothing but exit with a status of 0 (success). It is often used in shell scripts as a placeholder or to test a condition that is always true. When executed, the `true` command does not output any message or perform any action, it simply returns the exit code of 0 to the caller. In other words, the `true` command is used for its exit status rather than any actual functionality.
