# encfs 
## chatgpt 
encfs is a command-line program that is used for creating and managing encrypted file systems. It is a free and open-source software that can be installed on Linux, macOS, and other Unix-based operating systems.

When executed, the encfs command prompts the user to enter the location of the directory where the encrypted file system will be created (the source directory) and the location of the directory where the decrypted files will be mounted (the destination directory). After the directories have been specified, encfs creates a virtual encrypted file system in the destination directory.

Encryption is done using the AES algorithm, which is considered secure and reliable. The user can choose the level of encryption strength and decide on other encryption parameters like the size of the encryption key.

The encfs command has various options that users can use to customize the behavior of the command. For example, the --reverse option can be used to create a decrypted view of an encrypted directory. This option is useful when the user wants to access files in an encrypted directory without having to mount it.

Overall, the encfs command is a powerful tool to safeguard sensitive files and directories from unauthorized access. It provides a secure and efficient way to create and manage encrypted file systems on Linux and other Unix-based operating systems.

- Initialize or mount an encrypted filesystem:

`encfs {{/path/to/cipher_dir}} {{/path/to/mount_point}}`

- Initialize an encrypted filesystem with standard settings:

`encfs --standard {{/path/to/cipher_dir}} {{/path/to/mount_point}}`

- Run encfs in the foreground instead of spawning a daemon:

`encfs -f {{/path/to/cipher_dir}} {{/path/to/mount_point}}`

- Mount an encrypted snapshot of a plain directory:

`encfs --reverse {{path/to/plain_dir}} {{path/to/cipher_dir}}`
