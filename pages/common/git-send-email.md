# git send-email 
## chatgpt 
The 'git send-email' command is used to send Git commit patches or any other Git object changes via email. This command is particularly useful when working with a remote team or when you need to share your code changes with others for review.

Here are some of the basic steps to use the 'git send-email' command:

1. First, you need to ensure that you have a valid email client installed and configured on your system. Git will use the default email client for sending the patches, which can be set using the 'git config' command.

2. Next, you can use the 'git format-patch' command to generate a patch file for the changes you want to send. This command creates a formatted output of the changes that have been made in your local repository.

3. Once you have the patch file, you can use the 'git send-email' command to send it by email. This command launches your email client editor to compose the email, adds the patch file as an attachment, and fills in the email details such as the subject, recipients, and body.

4. Finally, you can review and edit the email details, add any necessary comments, and send the email to the appropriate recipients.

Overall, the 'git send-email' command streamlines the process of sharing code changes between developers and enables them to collaborate more efficiently.
