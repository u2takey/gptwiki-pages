# dolt merge 
## chatgpt 
The `dolt merge` command is used in Dolt, a version-controlled database system, to integrate changes from one branch of a database to another. The command combines the changes from a source branch into a destination branch, creating a new version of the database that includes the changes from both branches. 

The syntax for the command is `dolt merge [source-branch] [destination-branch]`. Here, the `source-branch` is the branch with changes that you want to merge into the `destination-branch`. The `destination-branch` is the branch you want to apply the changes to.

During a merge, Dolt compares the changes between the two branches and identifies any conflicts. A conflict occurs when the same row or columns have been modified in both branches, or when a column has been deleted in one branch and modified in another. In these cases, Dolt will prompt the user to resolve the conflict before continuing with the merge.

After resolving any conflicts, Dolt creates a new commit with the merged changes and updates the HEAD pointer to point to the new commit. The merged changes are now available in the `destination-branch`.

It is important to note that merging branches can result in data loss or incorrect data if conflicts are not resolved properly, so it is recommended to carefully review and test the changes before merging to ensure the database remains accurate and reliable.

- Incorporate changes from the named commits into the current branch:

`dolt merge {{branch_name}}`

- Incorporate changes from the named commits into the current branch without updating the commit history:

`dolt merge --squash {{branch_name}}`

- Merge a branch and create a merge commit even when the merge resolves as a fast-forward:

`dolt merge --no-ff {{branch_name}}`

- Merge a branch and create a merge commit with a specific commit message:

`dolt merge --no-ff -m "{{message}}" {{branch_name}}`

- Abort the current conflict resolution process:

`dolt merge --abort`
