# git cherry-pick 
## chatgpt 
The `git cherry-pick` command is used to apply a specific set of commits from one branch to another. This command extracts the changes made in a specific commit and applies them to a different branch.

Here's the syntax for the `git cherry-pick` command:

```
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

Here, <commit-hash> is the hash value of the commit you want to apply. You can also apply multiple commits by specifying multiple commit hashes with space between them.

This command creates a new commit in the target branch with the changes made in the specified commit. The commit message for the new commit is the same as the original commit message.

The `git cherry-pick` command is useful when you want to apply a specific set of changes made in another branch or by another developer, to your own branch. It's often used when you have a bug fix or a feature implemented in another branch that you want to apply to your own branch without merging the entire branch. 

Note that, when using git cherry-pick, conflicts between the original and target branch can arise. In such cases, Git will prompt you to resolve the conflicts manually. Once youâ€™ve resolved the conflicts, you'll need to add the changes, commit the merged files, and continue the `git cherry-pick` process.

- Apply a commit to the current branch:

`git cherry-pick {{commit}}`

- Apply a range of commits to the current branch (see also `git rebase --onto`):

`git cherry-pick {{start_commit}}~..{{end_commit}}`

- Apply multiple (non-sequential) commits to the current branch:

`git cherry-pick {{commit_1}} {{commit_2}}`

- Add the changes of a commit to the working directory, without creating a commit:

`git cherry-pick -n {{commit}}`
