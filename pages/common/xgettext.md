# xgettext 
## chatgpt 
xgettext is a command-line utility tool that extracts translatable messages from source code files and generates a .pot (Portable Object Template) file. This .pot file can be used as a template to create translation files for different languages.

The xgettext command takes several arguments, including the name(s) of the source code files that need to be processed, the output file name for the .pot file, and any options that modify the behavior of the tool.

Some commonly used options for the xgettext command include:

- --language: Specifies the source code language used in the input files. This option is useful when working with multilingual projects that use different programming languages.
- --output: Specifies the file name and path for the .pot file generated by xgettext.
- --add-comments: Includes the comments from the source code files in the .pot file. This option is useful for providing context to the translators.
- --no-wrap: Disables line wrapping in the output .pot file. This option can be useful when dealing with long strings or paragraphs.

Overall, the xgettext command is a powerful tool for automating the translation process in software development, making it easier to create and manage translation files for multilingual projects.

- Scan file and output strings to `messages.po`:

`xgettext {{path/to/input_file}}`

- Use a different output filename:

`xgettext --output {{path/to/output_file}} {{path/to/input_file}}`

- Append new strings to an existing file:

`xgettext --join-existing --output {{path/to/output_file}} {{path/to/input_file}}`

- Don't add a header containing metadata to the output file:

`xgettext --omit-header {{path/to/input_file}}`
