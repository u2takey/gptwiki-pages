Salt-call is a command used in SaltStack, an open-source configuration management and remote execution tool that helps automate repetitive tasks in a data center or cloud environment. The salt-call command is used to execute Salt state runs on a single minion, which is a machine managed by SaltStack.

When the salt-call command is executed, it contacts the Salt master server and retrieves the latest version of the Salt state tree, which contains the instructions for how the minion should be configured. The minion then applies these instructions to its own configuration, modifying files, installing packages, or executing other tasks according to the Salt states.

The salt-call command can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as checking the status of a minion, executing a single state module or a group of modules, refreshing the state of a minion from the Salt master, and many others. It can also be used in conjunction with other SaltStack commands to automate complex workflows and orchestrate the configuration of multiple minions.

Overall, salt-call is a powerful tool for managing the configuration of individual minions in a SaltStack environment, making it easier to automate infrastructure management and reduce manual intervention.
