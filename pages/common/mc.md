The command "mc" refers to the Midnight Commander, which is a text-based file manager for Unix-like operating systems. 

When the "mc" command is entered into the terminal, it opens the Midnight Commander application. From there, the user can navigate and manage their files and directories using a command-line interface. The interface has two panels where files and directories are displayed side by side, making it easy to move or copy files between directories.

Some of the most common tasks that can be performed with Midnight Commander include copying, moving, renaming, deleting, and editing files. It also supports archive management and file searching.

Overall, the "mc" command is a useful tool for users who prefer to work with files through the command line rather than using a graphical user interface.
