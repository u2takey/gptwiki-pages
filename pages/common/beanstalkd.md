Beanstalkd is a simple, fast, and easy-to-use open source job queue that is used to manage asynchronous job processing. It can be used in a variety of applications where different jobs or tasks need to be queued and processed in the background. Some of the features of beanstalkd include:

- Supports multiple clients and multiple workers
- Fast and efficient at handling millions of jobs
- Super lightweight and can be easily integrated into your application
- Provides a client API in many programming languages
- Offers persistence of jobs and settings

The command to start the beanstalkd server is usually '/usr/local/bin/beanstalkd', which can also be executed by simply typing 'beanstalkd' in the terminal or command prompt (depending on the operating system being used). This will start the server which will be available on default port 11300.

Once the server is started, clients can submit jobs to the queue, workers can reserve jobs from the queue and process them, and the server will manage the processing of jobs between the clients and workers. The client API provides several methods to interact with the server, including putting jobs into the queue, reserving and deleting jobs from the queue, and monitoring the status of the queue.

Overall, beanstalkd is a powerful tool that provides a simple and efficient way to manage asynchronous job processing and is widely used in various applications.

- Start beanstalkd, listening on port 11300:

`beanstalkd`

- Start beanstalkd listening on a custom port and address:

`beanstalkd -l {{ip_address}} -p {{port_number}}`

- Persist work queues by saving them to disk:

`beanstalkd -b {{path/to/persistence_directory}}`

- Sync to the persistence directory every 500 milliseconds:

`beanstalkd -b {{path/to/persistence_directory}} -f {{500}}`
