Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have access to context-specific information such as the meaning of "ani-cli". 

However, generally speaking, "cli" stands for Command Line Interface, which is a way to interact with a computer's operating system through text-based commands. 

Without knowing the specific context and purpose of "ani-cli", it is difficult to provide a detailed explanation of the command.
