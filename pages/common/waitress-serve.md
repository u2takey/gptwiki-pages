# waitress-serve

`waitress-serve` is a command that belongs to the Python package called "waitress". This package is used for serving Python web applications or APIs over HTTP/HTTPS. Specifically, `waitress-serve` is used to start up a Waitress server to serve a specified WSGI application. 

The `waitress-serve` command generally follows this format: 

```
waitress-serve [OPTIONS] APP_MODULE
```

where:
- `OPTIONS` are a set of configuration options that can be used to customize the behavior of the server. Some common options include `--host`, `--port`, and `--threads`. 
- `APP_MODULE` is the name of the Python module or file that contains the WSGI application that you want to serve. It should be specified in the format `<module_name>:<application_name>` or `<file_name>.py:<application_name>`. 

For example, the following command would start up a Waitress server to serve a WSGI application defined in a module called `myapp` that is located in a file called `main.py`:

```
waitress-serve --port=8080 main:myapp
```

This command would start up a server on port 8080 and serve the application defined in the `myapp` function in the `main` module. 

Once the `waitress-serve` command is executed, the Waitress server will listen on the specified port and wait for incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests. When a request is received, it will be passed to the specified WSGI application for processing, and the application's response will be sent back to the client. The server will continue running until it is explicitly stopped by the user.

- Run a Python web app:

`waitress-serve {{import.path:wsgi_func}}`

- Listen on port 8080 on localhost:

`waitress-serve --listen={{localhost}}:{{8080}} {{import.path:wsgi_func}}`

- Start waitress on a Unix socket:

`waitress-serve --unix-socket={{path/to/socket}} {{import.path:wsgi_func}}`

- Use 4 threads to process requests:

`waitress-serve --threads={{4}} {{import.path:wsgifunc}}`

- Call a factory method that returns a WSGI object:

`waitress-serve --call {{import.path.wsgi_factory}}`

- Set the URL scheme to HTTPS:

`waitress-serve --url-scheme={{https}} {{import.path:wsgi_func}}`
