The `meteor` command is used to start a local development server for building web and mobile applications using the Meteor framework. Here's what it does:

1. The command first checks if you have Meteor installed by running `meteor --version`. If you don't have Meteor installed, you'll be prompted to install it.

2. Once Meteor is installed, the `meteor` command creates a new directory for your project and sets up a basic file structure with the necessary configuration files, including a `package.json` file.

3. The command then starts a local development server on your machine, which you can access in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to your code will be automatically reloaded in the browser as you develop.

4. In addition to the local development server, `meteor` comes with a set of command-line tools for building and deploying your application to a production server. These tools include commands for creating new components, testing your code, and deploying to popular cloud hosting services.

Overall, the `meteor` command provides a fast and convenient way to set up a development environment for building modern, real-time web and mobile applications.
