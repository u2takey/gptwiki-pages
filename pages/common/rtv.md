Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not sure which specific command "rtv" you are referring to, as there are different software and tools in different systems/contexts that may use this command. 

Therefore, could you please provide more details about what system or context you are referring to? It would be easier for me to give you an accurate explanation once I know which specific command you are asking about.
