OpenSCAD is a command-line program used for creating 3D CAD models. The program allows users to create 3D models using a scripting language rather than a graphical user interface. This means that models are created through code, similar to programming languages like Python or Java.

With OpenSCAD, users can create complex models with precise measurements and intricate geometries. The program supports a variety of 3D modeling functions including union, intersection, difference, and projection. Additionally, OpenSCAD can export models in various standard 3D file formats like .STL and .DXF.

To use OpenSCAD, users will need to have the software installed on their computer. Once OpenSCAD is installed, the user can start creating 3D models through a combination of text-based commands and mathematical operations. These commands are entered into the program and executed by a compiler, which generates a 3D model based on the code.

Overall, OpenSCAD is a powerful tool for creating 3D models with precision and control. While it requires some programming knowledge, it provides users with a comprehensive set of tools for creating high-quality 3D models.
