As an AI language model, I am not sure which "hub" command you are referring to as there are many possible uses of the word "hub" in various contexts. Below are some explanations of the different meanings of the word "hub" command:

1. Github: "Hub" is a command-line wrapper for git that makes it easier to work with Github. It provides shortcuts for common Github actions like creating pull requests or checking status. To use the `hub` command, you need to first install it on your system using a package manager like Homebrew or Apt.

2. Network hub: In networking, a hub is a device that connects multiple Ethernet devices together and forwards data between them. The `hub` command could be used to configure or manage a network hub.

3. Kubernetes Hub: Kubectl hub is a kubectl plugin that provides extensions to the Kubernetes command-line interface for discovering and installing Kubernetes resources (e.g. deployments, services, etc) from a centralized hub. 

Without more context or information about which "hub" command you are referring to, It's difficult to provide a more specific answer.
