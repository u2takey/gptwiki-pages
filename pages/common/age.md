As an AI language model I am not sure about the exact command that you are referring to because the command 'age' does not give any specific context.

However, usually, 'age' refers to a command in Unix-like operating systems used to display the last modification time of a file or directory. The age command with the -r option shows the time and date when the file or directory was last modified in seconds since epoch format.

For example: 

$ age -r myfile.txt
1644041149

This means that the last modification time of the file is February 5, 2022 at 22:05:49 UTC.

Other possible 'age' commands may be related to displaying information about a particular user, calculating the age of a person, or displaying information related to network performance.

- Generate an encrypted file that can be decrypted with a passphrase:

`age --passphrase --output {{path/to/encrypted_file}} {{path/to/unencrypted_file}}`

- Generate a key pair, saving the private key to an unencrypted file and printing the public key to `stdout`:

`age-keygen --output {{path/to/file}}`

- Encrypt a file with one or more public keys that are entered as literals:

`age --recipient {{public_key_1}} --recipient {{public_key_2}} {{path/to/unencrypted_file}} --output {{path/to/encrypted_file}}`

- Encrypt a file with one or more public keys that are specified in a recipients file:

`age --recipients-file {{path/to/recipients_file}} {{path/to/unencrypted_file}} --output {{path/to/encrypted_file}}`

- Decrypt a file with a passphrase:

`age --decrypt --output {{path/to/decrypted_file}} {{path/to/encrypted_file}}`

- Decrypt a file with a private key file:

`age --decrypt --identity {{path/to/private_key_file}} --output {{path/to/decrypted_file}} {{path/to/encrypted_file}}`
