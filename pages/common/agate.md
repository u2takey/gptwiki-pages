Agate is not a command, but rather a Python library used for data analysis and manipulation. It provides a simple and flexible interface for working with tabular data, which can be loaded from a variety of formats, including CSV, Excel, JSON, and SQL databases.

Agate includes functionality for data cleaning, filtering, grouping, joining, and calculating summary statistics. It also supports data visualization through integration with popular Python libraries such as matplotlib and pandas.

To use agate, you need to install it first using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install agate
```
Once installed, you can import agate into your Python code and start using its data manipulation and analysis functions. For example, to load a CSV file and print its column names, you could use the following code:

```python
import agate

data = agate.Table.from_csv('my_csv_file.csv')
print(data.column_names)
```

This will create an agate Table object from the CSV file, and then print out the names of its columns. From there, you can use other agate functions to perform various analyses and manipulations on the data, depending on your needs.
