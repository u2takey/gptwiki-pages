The `spfquery` command is used to query the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record of a domain to determine whether a particular email message is authorized to be sent from a given IP address. This command helps to prevent email fraud and phishing attacks by verifying that the sender of an email is who they claim to be.

Here's how the `spfquery` command works:

1. The command is usually used with an email message and an IP address as parameters. For example:

```
spfquery -ip 198.51.100.1 -sender user@example.com
```

2. The command first looks up the SPF record of the domain associated with the sender's email address (in this case, `example.com`).

3. The SPF record is a DNS record that specifies which IP addresses are authorized to send email on behalf of the domain. The `spfquery` command checks whether the IP address provided is listed in the SPF record.

4. If the IP address is listed in the SPF record, the command returns a result of "pass". This means that the email message is authorized to be sent from that IP address.

5. If the IP address is not listed in the SPF record, the command returns a result of "fail". This means that the email message is not authorized to be sent from that IP address, and may be fraudulent or a phishing attempt.

Overall, the `spfquery` command is a useful tool for verifying the authenticity of email messages and reducing the risk of email fraud and phishing attacks.

- Check if an IP address is allowed to send an e-mail from the specified e-mail address:

`spfquery -ip {{8.8.8.8}} -sender {{sender@example.com}}`

- Turn on debugging output:

`spfquery -ip {{8.8.8.8}} -sender {{sender@example.com}} --debug`
