The `autopep8` command is a tool for automatically formatting and fixing style issues in Python code. 

When you run the `autopep8` command, it will analyze the code in a specified file (or directory) and make changes to the code, based on a set of predefined rules or guidelines. This tool is used to help ensure consistency and readability in your Python code.

The rules or guidelines used by `autopep8` are based on the "PEP 8" style guide for Python code. This guide outlines best practices for code layout, naming conventions, and other aspects of Python code.

After running `autopep8`, any style issues found in the code will be fixed automatically. This can include things like adding or removing whitespace, adjusting indentation, or changing the names of variables and functions to match the recommended style.

Overall, the `autopep8` command is a great tool for maintaining consistent and readable Python code, and can save time by automatically fixing style issues that may be difficult to spot manually.

- Format a file to `stdout`, with a custom maximum line length:

`autopep8 {{path/to/file.py}} --max-line-length {{length}}`

- Format a file, displaying a diff of the changes:

`autopep8 --diff {{path/to/file}}`

- Format a file in-place and save the changes:

`autopep8 --in-place {{path/to/file.py}}`

- Recursively format all files in a directory in-place and save changes:

`autopep8 --in-place --recursive {{path/to/directory}}`
