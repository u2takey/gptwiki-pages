# bazel 
## chatgpt 
Bazel is an open-source build and test tool that helps software developers create and manage software projects. It is designed to handle very large codebases, with multiple languages and libraries, and can scale from small projects to extensive codebases.

When you run the command "bazel" without any arguments, the tool will output its help documentation, which lists all available commands and their respective options and arguments. 

Here are some of the most common commands you can use with Bazel:

- `build`: This command builds the specified target or targets, which might be a binary, library, or test. You can specify the target using its name, label, or file path.

- `test`: This command runs the specified tests and reports their results. You can specify the tests using their name, label, or file path.

- `run`: This command builds and runs the specified binary target. You can specify the target using its name, label, or file path.

- `query`: This command queries the build graph and reports information about the targets and their dependencies. You can use different query languages to filter and format the output in various ways.

- `clean`: This command cleans the build output directories, removing all artifacts generated by Bazel.

- `info`: This command displays information about the Bazel installation, including its version, configuration, and environment.

There are many other commands you can use with Bazel, depending on your needs and workflow. Bazel supports various configuration options and extensions, allowing you to customize its behavior and integrate with other tools and platforms.
