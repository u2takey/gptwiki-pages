# dotnet publish

The command "dotnet publish" is used to create a deployable version of your .NET application. This command compiles your application and its dependencies, and creates an output folder that contains all the files necessary to run your application on the target environment.

The "dotnet publish" command requires that you specify the following parameters:

1. --framework: the target framework that your application is built on
2. --output: the output folder that the published files will be written to
3. --configuration: the build configuration (i.e. Debug or Release) that you want to publish

You can also specify additional parameters such as --runtime, which specifies the target runtime, and --self-contained, which indicates whether the generated output contains all the dependencies required for the application to run or not.

Once you run the "dotnet publish" command, it will perform the necessary tasks such as compiling code, copying dependencies, and creating the output folder. The resulting folder will contain the completed application, and can be deployed to the target environment as needed. Overall, "dotnet publish" is a useful command for creating deployable versions of your .NET application that can run on different platforms and environments.

- Compile a .NET project in release mode:

`dotnet publish --configuration Release {{path/to/project_file}}`

- Publish the .NET Core runtime with your application for the specified runtime:

`dotnet publish --self-contained true --runtime {{runtime_identifier}} {{path/to/project_file}}`

- Package the application into a platform-specific single-file executable:

`dotnet publish --runtime {{runtime_identifier}} -p:PublishSingleFile=true {{path/to/project_file}}`

- Trim unused libraries to reduce the deployment size of an application:

`dotnet publish --self-contained true --runtime {{runtime_identifier}} -p:PublishTrimmed=true {{path/to/project_file}}`

- Compile a .NET project without restoring dependencies:

`dotnet publish --no-restore {{path/to/project_file}}`

- Specify the output directory:

`dotnet publish --output {{path/to/directory}} {{path/to/project_file}}`
