Androguard is a tool used for reverse engineering of Android applications. It is an open-source Python library and capable of performing various analysis techniques to identify vulnerabilities and threats in the Android app.

The Androguard command typically involves the following steps:

1. Installation: One needs to install Androguard before using the tool. This can be done by running the following command:
```
pip install androguard
```
2. Working with APK files: APK files are the binary files of an Android app. Androguard can extract information from these files, like permissions, services, activities, etc. The command to extract information from an APK file is as follows:
```
androguard my_app.apk
```
This command will extract the necessary details from the APK file.

3. Analysing code: Androguard can also be used to analyze the Java code used in the Android application. The command to decompile the Java code is as follows:
```
androguard decompile my_app.apk
```
This command will decompile the Java code and display it on the console.

4. Finding vulnerabilities: Androguard can also be used to identify vulnerabilities in the Android application. For example, the command to identify a SQL injection attack is as follows:
```
androguard sqlinject my_app.apk
```
This command will scan the APK file for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Androguard is a powerful tool and can be used to perform various other tasks, like detecting malware, creating graphs, and much more. It is a must-have tool for any Android developer or security enthusiast.
