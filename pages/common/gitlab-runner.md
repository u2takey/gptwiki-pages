GitLab Runner is an open-source continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) tool that helps automate the delivery of software. The GitLab Runner is an application that works with GitLab CI/CD to manage and execute pipelines, which are a series of jobs or tasks that enable the automation of software delivery.

When using GitLab Runner, users typically install the Runner software on a separate machine, such as a development server or a server instance in the cloud. Once the software is installed, it can be registered with the GitLab CI/CD instance, and the Runner will be able to pull in updates, execute jobs and provide feedback on the status of the pipeline.

Some of the key features of GitLab Runner include the ability to:

- Run builds and tests in Docker or Kubernetes containers
- Manage multiple projects and pipelines
- Scale to accommodate large, complex pipelines
- Support custom scripts and variables for maximum flexibility

To get started with GitLab Runner, users typically follow these general steps:

1. Install GitLab Runner on a separate machine
2. Register the Runner with GitLab CI/CD
3. Define a pipeline in the GitLab CI/CD configuration file, which includes a series of tasks or jobs that the Runner will execute
4. Review the status of the pipeline on the GitLab CI/CD dashboard or through email notifications

Overall, GitLab Runner is a powerful tool for automating the delivery of software and enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment for teams.
