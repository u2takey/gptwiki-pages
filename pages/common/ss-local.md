The command "ss-local" is used to run a local Shadowsocks client. Shadowsocks is a secure socks5 proxy tool that encrypts traffic and bypasses internet censorship.

The "ss-local" command is typically used on the user’s local system. The Shadowsocks client encrypts traffic from the user’s system and sends it to a Shoawdowsocks server through a secure tunnel. The Shadowsocks server decrypts the traffic and forwards it to its destination.

The “ss-local” command is also used to maintain a connection to the Shadowsocks server until the user terminates it. After running the command, the Shadowsocks client will remain running in the background, securely routing all traffic through the Shadowsocks server.

Here is an example of the command structure:

ss-local -c /etc/shadowsocks.json

In this example, the "-c" option specifies a configuration file located in /etc/shadowsocks.json, which contains the server’s IP address, port number, encryption method, and password.

When the ss-local command is executed, it will generate a log file to monitor any events that occur during execution. This is helpful for troubleshooting issues with the Shadowsocks connection. 

Overall, the ss-local command is a useful tool for encrypting and securely routing internet traffic through a Shadowsocks server, bypassing censorship and ensuring online privacy.

- Run a Shadowsocks proxy by specifying the host, server port, local port, password, and encryption method:

`ss-local -s {{host}} -p {{server_port}} -l {{local port}} -k {{password}} -m {{encrypt_method}}`

- Run a Shadowsocks proxy by specifying the config file:

`ss-local -c {{path/to/config/file.json}}`

- Use a plugin to run the proxy client:

`ss-local --plugin {{plugin_name}} --plugin-opts {{plugin_options}}`

- Enable TCP fast open:

`ss-local --fast-open`
