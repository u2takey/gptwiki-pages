Snyk is a command-line tool that helps users identify and fix security vulnerabilities in their project dependencies. The command "snyk" alone starts the Snyk CLI, which can be used to scan applications for vulnerabilities, fix vulnerabilities, and monitor and manage dependencies to ensure they remain secure over time.

Specifically, the 'snyk' command allows users to:

- Authenticate: run 'snyk auth' to log in or register for a Snyk account
- Test your application: run 'snyk test' to test your application for known vulnerabilities
- Fix issues: run 'snyk test' followed by 'snyk wizard' to interactively fix vulnerabilities found by Snyk
- Monitor changes to your application: run 'snyk protect' to upgrade and monitor your dependencies for security issues
- Get help: run 'snyk --help' or 'snyk <command> --help' to get additional information about a specific command.

Overall, the 'snyk' command is a powerful tool for developers and application security teams to ensure their applications and dependencies are secure and up-to-date.
