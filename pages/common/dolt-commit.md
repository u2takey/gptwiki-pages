The `dolt commit` command is used in a version control system called Dolt. 

In simple terms, a commit can be thought of as a snapshot of the changes made to a database table. When you make changes to a table, you can create a commit to save those changes to the database's history. This way, you can revert to a previous version of the table if needed.

When you run the `dolt commit` command, you are creating a new commit for changes made to the database. The command requires you to provide a commit message, which explains the changes made in this commit. It's a good practice to keep the message clear, concise, and descriptive so that others can understand the changes made in the commit.

The commit command also requires you to stage the changes you want to commit. This means that you have to add the changes to the staging area before they can be committed. You can do this with the `dolt add` command.

Once the changes are staged, you can run the `dolt commit` command, and the changes will be saved in a new commit with the given commit message. This creates a new version of the table that can be accessed at any time in the future. 

Overall, the `dolt commit` command is a crucial tool for managing changes to a Dolt database table and keeping track of the table's version history.
