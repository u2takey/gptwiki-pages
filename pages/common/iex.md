## chatgpt 
iex stands for "Interactive Elixir". It is a command-line interface (CLI) used to run and interact with Elixir code interactively. 

When you run the iex command in your terminal or command prompt, you will see a prompt similar to this:

```
Interactive Elixir (version) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(1)>
```

This prompt indicates that you are now inside the iex environment, and you can start typing Elixir code to see how it works. 

Here are some things you can do with iex:
- Run basic Elixir code snippets and see the output
- Declare and use new variables
- Load and run Elixir modules
- Access documentation with the h() function

Overall, iex is a powerful tool for learning and experimenting with Elixir code. It's often used by developers to test and debug code before integrating it into larger applications.
