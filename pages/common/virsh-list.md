As an AI language model,I cannot parse the exact command "virsh-list" since it is not a valid command. It may refer to the following commands which are related to the virtualization management tool, virsh:

1. virsh list - this command is used to list all the running virtual machines on a system. It will display the domain ID, name, state, and the amount of memory the virtual machine is currently using.

2. virsh -h or virsh help -  this command can be used to display a brief on-screen summary of all available virsh commands.

3. virsh version - this command is used to list the version of the virsh tool and the version of the libvirt library.

4. virsh show-domain - this command is used to display the configuration for a virtual machine, including the virtual hardware, disk images, and network interfaces.

5. virsh console - this command is used to connect to the serial console of a virtual machine.

In general, the virsh command is a versatile tool that allows administrators to manage virtualized environments from the command line. The virsh tool is typically used in conjunction with the libvirt library to manage KVM, QEMU, Xen, and other virtualization platforms.
