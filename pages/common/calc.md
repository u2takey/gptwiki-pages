As an AI language model, I am not aware of any specific command called "calc" in any particular programming language or operating system. However, the word "calc" is commonly used as a shorthand for the term "calculator".

A calculator is a tool typically used for performing basic arithmetic, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Calculators can also perform more complex mathematical operations, as well as conversion between different units of measurement.

In a programming context, a calculator might refer to a software application designed to perform calculations using specific algorithms or programming logic. There are many programming languages that have built-in functions or libraries for performing mathematical operations, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.

If you provide more context or clarification on the specific language or operating system where you encountered the "calc" command, I may be able to provide a more detailed explanation.

- Start `calc` in interactive mode:

`calc`

- Perform a calculation in non-interactive mode:

`calc '{{85 * (36 / 4)}}'`

- Perform a calculation without any output formatting (for use with pipes):

`calc -p '{{4/3 * pi() * 5^3}}'`

- Perform a calculation and then switch to [i]nteractive mode:

`calc -i '{{sqrt(2)}}'`

- Start `calc` in a specific permission [m]ode (0 to 7, defaults to 7):

`calc -m {{mode}}`
