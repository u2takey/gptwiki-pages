# R 
## chatgpt 
R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, data visualization, and graphical representation. The command "R" simply launches the R software application, and opens a workspace where users can interact with the R environment by typing in commands in the console. Once inside the R environment, users can work with various data types like vectors, matrices, arrays, data frames, and lists. They can perform various statistical operations like regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and data visualization. Besides the built-in functions, R also provides access to a vast range of statistical packages and libraries through the "CRAN" repository, providing users with additional tools for data analytics and modeling. Overall, typing the "R" command in a command prompt or terminal opens up an environment where users can perform complex data analysis, modeling, and visualization tasks.

- Start R in vanilla mode (i.e. a blank session that doesn't save the workspace at the end):

`R --vanilla`

- Execute a file:

`R -f {{path/to/file.R}}`

- Execute an R expression and then exit:

`R -e {{expr}}`

- Run R with a debugger:

`R -d {{debugger}}`

- Check R packages from package sources:

`R CMD check {{path/to/package_source}}`
