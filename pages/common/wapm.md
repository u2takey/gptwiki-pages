Wapm is a command-line tool that allows developers to manage and install Rust packages. It is essentially an ecosystem for Rust libraries, making it easy to find and install packages from a central repository. 

Some commonly used wapm commands include:

- `wapm install <package>`: This command installs a package (specified by `<package>`) from the wapm repository. 
- `wapm search <query>`: This command searches the wapm repository for packages that match a given query (specified by `<query>`). 
- `wapm list`: This command lists all of the packages that have been installed using wapm. 
- `wapm update`: This command updates all installed packages to their latest versions. 
- `wapm info <package>`: This command shows information about a specific package (specified by `<package>`).

Wapm is particularly useful for Rust development, as it streamlines the process of managing dependencies and integrating third-party code into a project. By using wapm, developers can easily add new functionality to their Rust projects without reinventing the wheel, allowing them to write faster and more robust code.

- Interactively create a new `wapm.toml` file:

`wapm init`

- Download all the packages listed as dependencies in `wapm.toml`:

`wapm install`

- Download a specific version of a package and add it to the list of dependencies in wapm.toml:

`wapm install {{package_name}}@{{version}}`

- Download a package and install it globally:

`wapm install --global {{package_name}}`

- Uninstall a package and remove it from the list of dependencies in `wapm.toml`:

`wapm uninstall {{package_name}}`

- Print a tree of locally installed dependencies:

`wapm list`

- List top-level globally installed packages:

`wapm list --global`

- Execute a package command using the Wasmer runtime:

`wapm run {{command_name}} {{arguments}}`
