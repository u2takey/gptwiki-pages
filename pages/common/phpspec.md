The `phpspec` command is a command line tool used for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in PHP. It allows developers to write specifications or tests for their code in a descriptive language that is easy to understand and read.

Here are some of the main features and functionalities of the `phpspec` command:

1. Code Generation: `phpspec` can generate a skeleton PHP class and specification class for new classes, making it easy to get started with BDD.

2. Descriptive Testing: `phpspec` tests are written in a natural, descriptive language that makes them easy to read and understand.

3. Tests Isolation: `phpspec` runs tests in complete isolation, meaning that each test case is run independently of any other tests or external dependencies.

4. Easy Mocking: `phpspec` comes with built-in mocking capabilities, allowing developers to easily create mock objects for testing purposes.

5. Continuous Integration: `phpspec` can be integrated into continuous integration systems such as Jenkins or Travis CI, making it easy to automatically run tests as part of a bigger development process.

Overall, `phpspec` is a powerful tool for developers who want to adopt BDD practices in their PHP projects. By providing a simple and intuitive way to write tests, `phpspec` helps developers to write better code and catch bugs early in the development process.

- Create a specification for a class:

`phpspec describe {{class_name}}`

- Run all specifications in the "spec" directory:

`phpspec run`

- Run a single specification:

`phpspec run {{path/to/class_specification_file}}`

- Run specifications using a specific configuration file:

`phpspec run -c {{path/to/configuration_file}}`

- Run specifications using a specific bootstrap file:

`phpspec run -b {{path/to/bootstrap_file}}`

- Disable code generation prompts:

`phpspec run --no-code-generation`

- Enable fake return values:

`phpspec run --fake`
