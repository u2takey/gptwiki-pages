# darkhttpd 
## chatgpt 
Darkhttpd is a small and lightweight web server designed to serve static content over HTTP. The command "darkhttpd" is used to start the server and make it available on a specified port. This command takes the following syntax:

```
darkhttpd [options] [root] [address:port]
```

- [options]: This is an optional argument that allows you to specify additional settings for the server.
- [root]: This is the root directory of the website you want to serve. This can be an absolute or relative path.
- [address:port]: This is the IP address and port number where the server should listen for incoming requests. If no port number is specified, it defaults to port 80.

Some common options that you can pass to the command include:

- "-f": This runs the server in the foreground instead of daemonizing it.
- "-p": This sets the server's umask for newly created files and directories.
- "-u": This sets the user and group ID that the server should run as.

Once the server is running, you can access your website by typing the server's IP address or domain name into a web browser. Darkhttpd will then serve the requested files to the browser. If you make changes to the website's files, you will need to restart the server for the changes to take effect.
