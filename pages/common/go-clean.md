# go clean 
## chatgpt 
The command "go clean" is a terminal command specific to the Go programming language. Here's a detailed explanation:

- The "go" part of the command is the name of the programming language. It's also the executable that you install on your computer to run Go programs and commands.
- The "clean" part of the command is a verb that tells the "go" executable what to do. Specifically, it tells it to remove any output or artifacts that were generated from previous builds, compiled code, or other operations.
 
When you run "go clean", the following things happen:

- The command deletes any compiled code that was generated from previous builds or installations. This includes object files (.o), executables, and any other binary files that were created in the process.
- The command also deletes any test results or coverage files that were generated from running tests on your code.
- Finally, the "go clean" command deletes any cached build files that might be lying around, as well as any output files that are generated from running other "go" commands like "go install" or "go build".

Overall, the "go clean" command is useful when you want to start fresh with your Go environment and clean up any lingering files that might be causing problems. It's also a good idea to run this command periodically to keep your workspace clean and organized.
