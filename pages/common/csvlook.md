The command also allows you to customize the output by specifying various formatting options such as changing the delimiter, adjusting column width, and specifying a header row. These options can be set using various command-line flags such as "-d" or "--delimiter" and "-w" or "--max-width."

Overall, csvlook is a useful tool for quickly analyzing and visually inspecting CSV files in a readable format. It is especially beneficial for working with large amounts of data as it provides a quick and easy way to view and understand the information.
