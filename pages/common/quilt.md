`quilt` is a command line tool for managing a series of patches.

Here's a brief overview of what `quilt` does:

1. Maintains a series of patches: `quilt` maintains a series of patch files, each representing a change to the source code.
2. Applies and unapplies patches: `quilt` can apply and unapply patches to and from the source code. This allows you to test changes to the code without making permanent changes.
3. Tracks changes made: `quilt` tracks the changes you make to the code using the series of patches. This allows you to easily make changes and test them without losing track of what has and hasn't been changed.
4. Reverses changes: `quilt` can reverse changes made by a patch, allowing you to easily undo a change if it doesn't work out as expected.
5. Collapses patches: `quilt` can collapse or merge patches, allowing you to group related changes together.

To use `quilt`, you typically create a series of patch files, each representing a change to the source code. You can then apply, unapply, or modify the patches as needed. Once you're satisfied with your changes, you can merge the patches together to create a final set of changes to the code. 

Overall, `quilt` is a powerful tool for managing changes to code and is especially useful for working with large projects where it's important to stay organized and keep track of changes over time.

- Import an existing patch from a file:

`quilt import {{path/to/filename.patch}}`

- Create a new patch:

`quilt new {{filename.patch}}`

- Add a file to the current patch:

`quilt add {{path/to/file}}`

- After editing the file, refresh the current patch with the changes:

`quilt refresh`

- Apply all the patches in the series file:

`quilt push -a`

- Remove all applied patches:

`quilt pop -a`
