As an AI language model, I cannot interact with the system or perform functions like installing 'comby' command. However, I can provide you with some useful information about 'comby'.

'comby' is a command-line tool that helps you quickly and easily perform search and replace operations across files and directories. It supports a wide range of programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, C++, and many more.

The syntax of the command is as follows:

comby PATTERN REPLACEMENT PATH [ARGUMENTS]

Here are some explanations of the key elements in the syntax:

- PATTERN: This is the regular expression or matching pattern used to find the text you want to replace within files.
- REPLACEMENT: This is the text you want to replace the matches with.
- PATH: This is the directory or file path(s) in which you want 'comby' to look for and replace text.
- ARGUMENTS: There are optional arguments that you can use to customize the behavior of the command, such as specifying file types to search in or excluding certain files from the search.

Here's an example of how you might use the 'comby' command:

comby 'foo()' 'bar()' path/to/files/ --types=js

In this case, 'comby' would search for all occurrences of the 'foo()' function call in all JavaScript files within the 'path/to/files/' directory (and its subdirectories), and replace them with 'bar()'. The '--types=js' argument tells 'comby' to only search in JavaScript files.

Overall, 'comby' is a powerful command-line utility for quickly and efficiently performing search and replace operations across multiple files and directories, and it can be especially useful for developers who work with large codebases.

- Match and rewrite templates, and print changes:

`comby '{{assert_eq!(:[a], :[b])}}' '{{assert_eq!(:[b], :[a])}}' {{.rs}}`

- Match and rewrite with rewrite properties:

`comby '{{assert_eq!(:[a], :[b])}}' '{{assert_eq!(:[b].Capitalize, :[a])}}' {{.rs}}`

- Match and rewrite in-place:

`comby -in-place '{{match_pattern}}' '{{rewrite_pattern}}'`

- Only perform matching and print matches:

`comby -match-only '{{match_pattern}}' ""`
