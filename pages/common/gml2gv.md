# gml2gv

The "gml2gv" command is used to convert Graph Modeling Language (GML) files to Graphviz (GV) format. GML is a text-based format used for representing graphs and networks, while Graphviz is a graph visualization tool that can be used to draw graphs in various formats, including PNG, PDF, and SVG.

The gml2gv command takes a GML file as input and converts it to a Graphviz file in DOT syntax. The resulting DOT file can then be processed by Graphviz to generate a visualization of the graph.

Here's an example of how to use the gml2gv command:

```
gml2gv mygraph.gml > mygraph.dot
dot -Tpng mygraph.dot -o mygraph.png
```

In this example, we first use the gml2gv command to convert the GML file "mygraph.gml" to a DOT file "mygraph.dot". We then use the "dot" command (one of the tools provided by Graphviz) to generate a PNG image of the graph, which we save to a file named "mygraph.png".

The gml2gv command can be useful for converting GML files produced by various graph generators and analysis tools to the Graphviz format, allowing the resulting graphs to be visualized using the powerful Graphviz visualization engine.

- Convert a graph from `gml` to `gv` format:

`gml2gv -o {{output.gv}} {{input.gml}}`

- Convert a graph using `stdin` and `stdout`:

`cat {{input.gml}} | gml2gv > {{output.gv}}`

- Display help:

`gml2gv -?`
