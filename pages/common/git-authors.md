# git authors 
## chatgpt 
There is not a built-in command in Git called "git authors". It is possible that this command has been created as an alias or custom script by a user or by a particular Git hosting service.

However, assuming that the command shows a list of authors who have contributed to a Git repository, here is how it could be done:

1. First, navigate to the Git repository on your local machine using the command line.

2. Then, run the command `git log --format='%aN' | sort -u`. This command will output a list of all unique author names who have contributed to the Git repository. 

Let's break down the command:

- `git log` is the command to display commit logs. 
- `--format='%aN'` specifies that we only want to output the author name for each commit. 
- `|` is a pipe, which means that we are redirecting the output of `git log` to the next command. 
- `sort -u` sorts the output alphabetically and removes duplicate entries.

Overall, the `git log` command can be used for exploring the commit history of a Git repository. Adding the `--format` option allows us to customize the output and display only specific information, such as the author names.

- Print a full list of committers to `stdout` instead of to the `AUTHORS` file:

`git authors --list`

- Append the list of committers to the `AUTHORS` file and open it in the default editor:

`git authors`

- Append the list of committers, excluding emails, to the `AUTHORS` file and open it in the default editor:

`git authors --no-email`
