Gource is a software version control visualization tool that creates an animated visualization of the activity of a software project over time. It displays a visual representation of a repository that includes directories, files, and the movement of file contents throughout time.

The command "gource" is used to start the visualization process. To use it, you need to have a Git, Subversion, Mercurial, or Bazaar repository set up on your machine.

Once you have the repository, you can run the "gource" command, followed by the path to the source directory, and any additional settings you want to use, such as the size of the window or the duration of the animation.

The resulting visualization shows a timeline of the project, with each contributor represented by a different color, and files and directories displayed as nodes. The size of the node corresponds to the number of edits, and the thickness of the branch shows the level of activity. The animation shows the movement of files and their contents over time, as well as changes in code ownership, and can be customized using a variety of settings. 

Overall, gource provides a unique and dynamic way to visualize the evolution of a software project and identify trends in development patterns.

- Run gource in a directory (if it isn't the repository's root directory, the root is sought up from there):

`gource {{path/to/repository}}`

- Run gource in the current directory, with a custom output resolution:

`gource -{{width}}x{{height}}`

- Set a custom timescale for the animation:

`gource -c {{time_scale_multiplier}}`

- Set how long each day should be in the animation (this combines with -c, if provided):

`gource -s {{seconds}}`

- Set fullscreen mode and a custom background color:

`gource -f -b {{hex_color_code}}`

- Set a title for the animation:

`gource --title {{title}}`
