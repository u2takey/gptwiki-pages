`gitk` is a graphical user interface tool (GUI) that provides advanced visualization of the history and changes of a Git repository. It is a built-in tool and does not require any additional installation or configuration. The `gitk` command can be used from the command line or a terminal window, and it will launch the Gitk Graphical User Interface (GUI) window.

Gitk is useful for viewing the repository and its history, including branch and tag information, commit details, and file changes over time. It allows the user to easily navigate through the changes made to the repository and analyze the code changes made at different points. Most commonly, Gitk is used to identify issues, conflicts, and bugs in the code by providing a visual presentation of the changes to the codebase.

In Gitk GUI, you can see different views of your repository, which include:

- Commit Graph: It is the central view where you can see the commit history of your repository.

- Tree View: It displays the repository in a tree view, showing files and directories.

- File View: It shows the changes that were made to a specific file in a commit.

- Patch Viewer: It displays the patch for selected changes.

Gitk also provides several customization options, allowing users to filter commits by time, author, specific changes, tags, branches, and more.

In short, the `gitk` command is a powerful tool for reviewing the history of a Git repository, analyzing changes, resolving conflicts, and identifying issues using its graphical user interface.
