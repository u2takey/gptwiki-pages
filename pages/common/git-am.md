The "git am" command is used to apply a series of patches stored in an mbox-format mailbox. It reads the patches from the standard input or from a named file, applies them to the local repository, and commits the changes. 

Here's how the command works:

1. First, the patches to be applied must be in the mbox format. This means that they are in a plain text file with a specific structure, where each patch begins with a "From" line and ends with an empty line.

2. Next, the user runs the "git am" command, followed by the name of the mbox file containing the patches. Alternatively, they can pipe the patches into the command using a pipe operator, like this: "git am < patches.mbox".

3. Git will then read the patches from the mbox file or the standard input, and apply them to the current branch in the repository.

4. If the patch applies cleanly, git will automatically create a commit with a commit message based on the "Subject" line of the patch. If the patch cannot be applied directly (due to conflicts, for example), git will stop and ask the user to resolve the conflicts manually before proceeding.

5. After all the patches have been applied, the user can run "git log" to see the commit history and verify that the changes have been applied correctly. 

Overall, the "git am" command is a useful tool for applying a series of patches to a repository, especially when working with patches generated by another tool or sent via email.

- Apply a patch file:

`git am {{path/to/file.patch}}`

- Abort the process of applying a patch file:

`git am --abort`

- Apply as much of a patch file as possible, saving failed hunks to reject files:

`git am --reject {{path/to/file.patch}}`
