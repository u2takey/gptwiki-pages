Goimports is a command-line tool used in the Go programming language to automatically add or remove necessary imports in a Go program. 

When we are working on a Go project, we may use many external packages, and we need to import them in our code to use their functions or variables. Goimports takes care of this task automatically by analyzing the code and identifying which packages are being used and where they need to be imported in the code.

Goimports is based on the gofmt tool, a standard formatting tool for Go code. It uses the same command-line interface as gofmt, so it's easy to use.

Here's how it works:

1. Analyzing imported packages: Goimports analyzes the code to identify which packages are imported in your code and which ones are not used.

2. Adding missing imports: For any missing imports, Goimports will add the relevant import statements to the beginning of the file.

3. Removing unused imports: If Goimports identifies any unused imports, it will remove them from the code.

4. Formatting code: As already mentioned, Goimports is based on gofmt, so it applies the same formatting rules to your code.

Overall, goimports is a powerful tool that helps developers save a lot of time when managing package imports in their Go code. It is recommended to use it before committing changes to avoid future errors in the code.

- Display the completed import source file:

`goimports {{path/to/file}}.go`

- Write the result back to the source file instead of the standard output:

`goimports -w {{path/to/file}}.go`

- Display diffs and write the result back to the source file:

`goimports -w -d {{path/to/file}}.go`

- Set the import prefix string after 3rd-party packages (comma-separated list):

`goimports -local {{path/to/package}} {{path/to/file}}.go`
