As an AI language model, I do not have access to every possible command on every platform. However, I can provide an explanation in general terms.

The command "wipeclean" likely refers to a software tool or program that is meant to clean or erase data from a storage device. This command would typically be used to wipe all data from a hard drive or other storage device, making it impossible to recover any of the data that had previously been stored on it.

The specific usage of the wipeclean command will depend on the platform or software it is associated with, and it is important to be careful when using such a tool, as it can permanently erase data that you may need later. Always make sure to have a backup of important information before proceeding with any data-wiping commands.
