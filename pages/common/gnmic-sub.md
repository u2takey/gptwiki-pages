The "gnmic sub" command is a sub-command of the gnmic CLI tool which is used to subscribe to streaming telemetry data from network devices that support the gNMI (gRPC Network Management Interface) protocol. Here is a breakdown of the command:

- ```gnmic``` is the name of the CLI tool used for interacting with network devices that support gNMI.
- ```sub``` is the sub-command used for subscribing to streaming telemetry data.

By running this command, the user is instructing the gnmic tool to initiate a subscription to receive streaming telemetry data from the target device. The tool will establish a gRPC session with the device and begin receiving data as it is generated. The user can specify various options and parameters to customize the subscription, such as the target device, the specific data to subscribe to, the update frequency, and the format of the output.

Overall, the "gnmic sub" command is a powerful tool for network administrators and engineers to monitor and troubleshoot network performance in real-time.
