The `fossil forget` command is used to remove a file or a set of files from version control system. When a file is deleted from your local repository and you donâ€™t want to keep any version history of that file in your Fossil repository, you can use the `fossil forget` command to remove it.

Here are some key points about the `fossil forget` command:

- This command will not remove the physical file from the disk. It just removes the file from the version control system.
- Once you have removed a file using `fossil forget`, you cannot recover it using the usual version control commands. If you want to get back a file that you have forgotten, you will need to manually restore an earlier copy.
- If you forget a file that has never been committed, you do not need to use the `fossil addremove` command afterwards because the file will already be added to the ignore list.

To use the `fossil forget` command, you need to provide the path to the file or directory that you want to remove. Here is an example:

```
$ fossil forget myfile.txt
```

In this example, `myfile.txt` will be removed from the version control system. If you want to remove multiple files or directories, you can use wildcards like `*` or `?`. For example:

```
$ fossil forget *.txt
```

This command will remove all files with a `.txt` extension from the repository.
