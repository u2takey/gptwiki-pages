# gnmic get 
## chatgpt 
The command "gnmic get" is a command-line tool used to retrieve data from network devices using the gNMI (gRPC Network Management Interface) protocol. 

Here's a breakdown of the command syntax and what they mean:

- "gnmic": This is the name of the gNMI client tool being used to send requests to the target network device(s). It must be installed and present in the system path to run this command. 

- "get": This is the subcommand that specifies the type of action to be taken. In this case, we're requesting data from the device(s). 

When we run "gnmic get", we're prompting the tool to initiate a gNMI "Get" RPC request to the target network device(s). This request is used to retrieve one or more values from the device's data model, which must support the gNMI protocol. 

The "get" command has several options that can be used to customize the request, such as:

- "-t": This specifies the target device(s) to retrieve data from. It can be a hostname or IP address, and multiple targets can be specified in a comma-separated list. 

- "-v": This allows specifying the version of the gNMI protocol to be used. The default is 0.6.0.

- "-x": This specifies the encoding format for the response data, such as JSON or protobuf. 

- "-P": This specifies the path to the data to retrieve within the device's data model. It can be specified using dot notation (e.g. "interfaces.interface[name=eth0].state.operStatus").

- "-y": This allows the output format to be customized, such as JSON or text. The default is text. 

Overall, "gnmic get" is a powerful tool for retrieving data from network devices using the gNMI protocol, and can be customized to fit specific needs.

- Get a snapshot of the device state at a specific path:

`gnmic --address {{ip:port}} get --path {{path}}`

- Query the device state at multiple paths:

`gnmic -a {{ip:port}} get --path {{path1}} --path {{path2}}`

- Query the device state at multiple paths with a common prefix:

`gnmic -a {{ip:port}} get --prefix {{prefix}} --path {{path1}} --path {{path2}}`

- Query the device state and specify reponse encoding (json_ietf):

`gnmic -a {{ip:port}} get --path {{path}} --encoding json_ietf`
