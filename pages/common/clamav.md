# ClamAV 
## chatgpt 
ClamAV is a command-line utility for scanning files and directories for viruses and malware. It uses signature-based detection, heuristics, and other advanced techniques to detect known and unknown threats.

Some of the key features of ClamAV include:

- Automatic updates: ClamAV is updated regularly with the latest virus definitions, so it can detect even the newest threats.
- Multi-platform support: ClamAV is available for a variety of platforms, including Linux, BSD, macOS, and Windows.
- Support for archives: ClamAV can scan inside compressed archives (such as Zip, RAR, and Tar) to detect threats that may be hidden inside.
- Lightweight: ClamAV is designed to be fast and efficient, so it won't slow down your system while scanning.

To use ClamAV, you simply need to open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

clamscan [options] [file/directory]

Replace [options] with any additional options you want to use (such as -r to recursively scan subdirectories), and [file/directory] with the file or directory you want to scan.

ClamAV will then scan the specified file or directory for viruses and malware, and will report any threats that it finds. You can then take appropriate action to remove or quarantine the infected files.
