"DAPS" is a command-line tool for creating and managing digital certificates and related credentials. It provides cryptographic APIs and interfaces for certificate authorities and certificate chains management.

It is developed by the openSUSE Project and used by various open source software projects, including YaST, build-service, and Open Build Service. DAPS is mainly used for signing packages and generating code-signing certificates.

When executed, the "daps" command can perform various operations like creating a private key, a certificate request, a self-signed certificate, building a certificate chain, generating a signing key, and signing a package. The command also supports various options like specifying the algorithm used for the keypair, the size of the RSA key, and the validity period of a certificate.

Overall, the "daps" command is a powerful tool for managing digital certificates and keys for secure communication and authentication.
