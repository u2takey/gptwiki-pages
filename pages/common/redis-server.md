# redis-server

The command "redis-server" is used to start a Redis server instance. It is used primarily to set up and run Redis on a machine.

When you run the command "redis-server" in your terminal, it starts the Redis server and listens for incoming client connections on the default port number specified in the configuration file. Usually, the default port number is 6379.

Once the server is up and running, clients can connect to it using various Redis clients like Redis-cli, Python Redis client, Node.js Redis client, etc., and can start interacting with the Redis data store.

While running the command, extra configurations can also be provided using the command-line arguments. These arguments provide further customization in setting up the Redis server on the system. For example, we can specify the log file path, binding address, port number, password, etc., in the command while starting the Redis server.

In summary, the "redis-server" command is used to start and set up a Redis server instance and enables clients to connect and interact with it.
