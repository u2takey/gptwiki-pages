The `mesg` command in Linux is used to control the access to your terminal by other users. It stands for "message." When you log into a terminal, other users on the same system can send you messages using the `write` command. The `mesg` command can be used to permit or deny these messages.

The syntax of the `mesg` command is as follows:

```
mesg [y|n]
```

Here, `[y|n]` specifies whether to allow (`y`) or deny (`n`) messages to the user. If `[y|n]` is not specified, the current status of the `mesg` setting is displayed.

If messages are allowed, other users can use the `write` command to send messages to your terminal. For example, if another user wants to send a message to the user `john`, they can use the following command:

```
$ write john
```

This will allow the user to type in a message to be sent to `john`.

If messages are denied, other users will receive a message stating that messages to the user are not permitted.

In summary, the `mesg` command is a simple command used for controlling terminal access by allowing or disallowing messages to be sent to a particular user's terminal.
