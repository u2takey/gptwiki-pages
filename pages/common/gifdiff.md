I am sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to your local system or any third-party tools or software installed on it. However, I can give you a general idea about what the command 'gifdiff' does.

'gifdiff' is a command-line tool used to compare two GIF images and visualize their visual differences. It is a part of the 'giflib' library, which is used to manipulate and create GIF images. The tool takes two input files as arguments, and the output is a visual representation of the differences between the two GIF images. The output image highlights the pixels that have changed between the two input images, making it easy to spot the differences.

The command has various options to specify the output format, colors, and other parameters of the output image. It is useful for comparing two similar-looking images or for checking the accuracy of an image manipulation process.

Overall, 'gifdiff' is a handy tool for quickly identifying differences between two GIF images at the pixel level.
