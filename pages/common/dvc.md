dvc is a command-line tool that facilitates the process of managing machine learning models and their associated data. It stands for Data Version Control.

Here are some commonly used subcommands of dvc:

- init: Initializes a new DVC project in the current directory, creating necessary configuration files and directories.
- add: Adds a new file or directory to DVC tracking. It creates a small DVC file with the same name as the original file, which contains metadata related to the file, such as its checksum and the command used to generate it.
- run: Runs a command with its inputs and outputs tracked by DVC. It also creates a DVC file that describes the command's dependencies and outputs.
- pull: Downloads data and models required to run a DVC project from a remote storage that has been previously configured.
- push: Uploads data and models to a remote storage previously set up using dvc remote add command.
- repro: Reproduces the pipeline for a specific stage, ensuring that all dependencies are up-to-date and rerunning when necessary.

Overall, dvc helps to keep track of changes made to both the code and the data, ensures reproducibility, and simplifies collaboration with other members of the team.
