# git for-each-repo 
## chatgpt 
As an AI language model, I do not have access to any specific command features or functionalities outside of what is publicly available. However, the `git for-each-repo` command does not appear to be an official git command. It is possible that this command is a custom script or an alias created by a user or organization to iterate through multiple git repositories and perform a specific action. Without more context, it is not possible to provide a detailed explanation of what this command does.

- Run maintenance on each of a list of repositories stored in the `maintenance.repo` user configuration variable:

`git for-each-repo --config={{maintenance.repo}} {{maintenance run}}`

- Run `git pull` on each repository listed in a global configuration variable:

`git for-each-repo --config={{global_configuration_variable}} {{pull}}`
