`Minetest` is a free and open-source block-based sandbox game that allows players to build and explore virtual worlds. It is similar to the popular game Minecraft, but with some differences in gameplay and features.

To use the `minetest` command, you must have the game installed on your device. Once installed, you can launch the game by typing `minetest` in your command line interface (for example, Terminal on Mac or Linux, or Command Prompt on Windows).

The `minetest` command launches the game and allows you to start playing or exploring the options and settings. When the game is launched, you will see the main menu screen, where you can choose to create a new world, join an existing world, or customize the game settings.

In addition to the basic gameplay features, `minetest` also has a robust modding system that allows users to customize the game by adding new blocks, tools, and game mechanics. You can explore and install mods through the in-game mod manager, or by downloading them from the internet and installing manually.
