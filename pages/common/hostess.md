As an AI language model, I can provide you the details about the various commands in general, but I have access to the context or system you are working on. However, I assume that you are referring to the "hostess" command and it is related to the host file.

The hostess command is a third-party command-line tool that allows you to manage your /etc/hosts file easily. The /etc/hosts file is a system file included in all UNIX and UNIX-like systems (including macOS and Linux). This file maps hosts to IP addresses.

Using the hostess command, you can easily add, remove and modify entries in your /etc/hosts file without opening it in a text editor. It can be a convenient way to manage IP addresses and domains when dealing with complex network configurations.

The hostess command provides several options, including:

- add: add a new entry to the /etc/hosts file
- remove: remove an entry from the /etc/hosts file
- list: display the contents of the /etc/hosts file
- edit: open the /etc/hosts file in your default text editor for direct editing
- flush: clear all entries from the /etc/hosts file

For example, if you want to add a new entry to your /etc/hosts file using the hostess command, you would use the following syntax:

```
hostess add 127.0.0.1 mydomain.local
```

This would add an entry that maps the IP address 127.0.0.1 to the domain name mydomain.local in your /etc/hosts file.

Overall, the hostess command is a useful tool for managing your /etc/hosts file more effectively, and can be especially helpful for developers and network administrators who need to manage complex network configurations.
