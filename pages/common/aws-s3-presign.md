# aws s3 presign 
## chatgpt 
The AWS S3 presign command creates a URL that can be used to access an S3 object for a limited time period. This URL can be used to grant temporary access to that specific S3 object to a user or application without requiring them to have AWS credentials. 

The syntax of the command is as follows:

```
aws s3 presign s3://bucket/key [--expires-in seconds] [--region region] [--profile profile-name] [--endpoint endpoint-url] [--http-method http-method]
```

Where:

- `s3://bucket/key`: specifies the S3 object that you want to presign. The key is the path to the object within the bucket.

- `--expires-in seconds`: specifies how long the presigned URL is valid, in seconds. The default value is 3600 seconds (1 hour).

- `--region region`: specifies the AWS region where the S3 bucket is located. The default value is the region specified in the AWS CLI configuration.

- `--profile profile-name`: specifies the AWS CLI profile to use for the presign command. If not specified, the default profile is used.

- `--endpoint endpoint-url`: specifies the S3 endpoint URL to use. This option is only needed if you are using a non-AWS S3-compatible endpoint.

- `--http-method http-method`: specifies the HTTP method to use for the presigned URL. The default value is `GET`. Other supported values are `PUT`, `POST`, and `DELETE`.

When the command is run, it generates a presigned URL that can be used to access the specified S3 object for the duration specified by the `--expires-in` option. This URL includes a signature that verifies that the requester has permission to access the object for that time period. The URL can be provided to users or applications that need temporary access to the object. Once the time period has expired, the URL can no longer be used to access the object.

- Generate a pre-signed URL for a specific S3 object that is valid for one hour:

`aws s3 presign s3://{{bucket_name}}/{{path/to/file}}`

- Generate a pre-signed URL valid for a specific lifetime:

`aws s3 presign s3://{{bucket_name}}/{{path/to/file}} --expires-in {{duration_in_seconds}}`
