# git annotate 
## chatgpt 
The "git annotate" command is used to display information about who last modified each line of a file along with the commit message and the commit hash. It also shows the date and time when the change was made. 

Syntax: 

```
git annotate <file>
```

Example: 

Suppose we want to find out who last modified each line of a file called "index.html". Here's how we can use the "git annotate" command for this purpose:

```
git annotate index.html
```

This will display the following information for each line in the file:

- Commit hash: A unique identifier for the commit that last modified the line
- Author: The name and email address of the person who made the change
- Date and Time: The date and time when the change was made
- Line content: The actual content of the line

The output of the "git annotate" command can be useful in identifying when and who made a specific change to a file. Additionally, it helps in tracking changes and making sure everyone is working on the latest version of the file.
