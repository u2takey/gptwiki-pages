"sh" is a command used in Unix-based operating systems to launch a shell. A shell is a command-line interface used to interact with the operating system. When the "sh" command is executed, it launches a new shell session, allowing the user to enter commands and run programs in the terminal. 

Once the new shell session is launched, the user can execute any available commands and programs, including navigating through the file system, manipulating files and directories, and running scripts. The shell can also be configured with environment variables, aliases, and functions to customize the user experience.

In addition to "sh", Unix-based systems have other commands that can launch different shells such as "bash", "csh", "ksh", and "zsh". Each shell has unique features and syntax that can affect the behavior of the commands and scripts executed within the shell.
