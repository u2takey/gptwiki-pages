# git notes

The `git notes` command in Git allows you to attach free-form notes to objects in the repository, such as commits or blobs. These notes provide extra information and context to the objects in the repository, which can be useful for maintaining a history of changes or tracking additional information about the project.

Some common use cases for `git notes` include:

- Adding review comments to specific commits or lines of code
- Tracking issues or bugs associated with specific commits or branches
- Adding documentation or other contextual information to commits or blobs

To use the `git notes` command, you must first decide on the object to which you want to attach the note (e.g., a commit). You can then create a new note using the `git notes add` command, followed by the SHA-1 of the object and the text of the note. For example:

```
git notes add abc123 This commit needs to be reviewed for performance improvements.
```

This command attaches a new note to the commit with the SHA-1 `abc123`.

To view the notes attached to an object, you can use the `git notes show` command, followed by the SHA-1 of the object. For example:

```
git notes show abc123
```

This command displays the note attached to the commit with the SHA-1 `abc123`.

You can also edit or remove existing notes using the `git notes edit` and `git notes remove` commands, respectively.

Overall, `git notes` is a useful tool for adding context and additional information to objects in your Git repository, allowing you to maintain a more detailed and informative history of your project.
