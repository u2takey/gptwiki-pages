# clojure 
## chatgpt 
The command "clojure" refers to the command-line interface (CLI) for the Clojure programming language. Clojure is a dialect of Lisp that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is designed for concurrency and functional programming.

When you enter the "clojure" command in your terminal, it will launch a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment, which allows you to interactively write and evaluate Clojure code. The REPL accepts commands, expressions, and function definitions, and provides you with immediate feedback on each evaluation.

You can use the Clojure CLI to create new Clojure projects, compile and run code, and manage dependencies. The CLI tool also provides access to documentation and various configuration options.

Overall, the "clojure" command is the entry point to the Clojure environment and allows developers to leverage the powerful features of Clojure to build efficient and robust applications.
