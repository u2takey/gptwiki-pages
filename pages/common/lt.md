As an AI language model, I'm not sure which domain this question relates to. However, given below is a general explanation of the command 'lt':

The command 'lt' is not a standard or widely used command in most operating systems or programming languages. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a detailed explanation without more context on its usage. 

However, in some cases, 'lt' may be interpreted as an abbreviation for "less than." In this context, it can be used in programming languages such as Python, for comparison operators. For example, we can use the symbol '<' to compare two values in Python to check if one value is less than the other. 

Below is an example of the usage of '<' operator in Python:

```
x = 5
y = 10
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
```
 
In the above code snippet, the operator '<' is used to compare the values of x and y. Since x is less than y, the code inside the if block will be executed, and the output displayed will be "x is less than y." 

Overall, the 'lt' command, when interpreted as the "less than" operator, can be used in programming contexts to compare values and evaluate true or false statements.
