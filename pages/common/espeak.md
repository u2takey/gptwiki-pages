Espeak is a command-line tool used for speech synthesis, which converts input text into audible speech output. It is available for Linux, Windows, and other operating systems. The syntax for the espeak command is as follows:

`espeak [options] [text]`

Here, `[options]` represents the various optional arguments that can be used to configure the speech output, and `[text]` is the input text that needs to be converted into speech.

Some of the commonly used options with the espeak command include:

- `-v` or `--voice`: This option specifies the voice to be used for the speech synthesis. Espeak supports multiple voices, and the voice can be given either as a name or a language code.
- `-p` or `--pitch`: This option sets the pitch of the speech output.
- `-s` or `--speed`: This option sets the speed of the speech output in words per minute.
- `-g` or `--gap`: This option sets the gap between words in milliseconds.
- `-w` or `--stdout`: This option redirects the output to standard output instead of playing it through the sound card.

To use the espeak command, simply open the command prompt or terminal and type in the command followed by the input text (enclosed in quotes if it contains spaces or special characters) and any desired options. For example, the following command would generate speech output for the text "Hello, World!" using the default voice and settings:

`espeak "Hello, World!"`

Overall, espeak is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used for a variety of applications, including assistive technology, language learning, and computer-generated voiceovers.

- Speak a phrase aloud:

`espeak "I like to ride my bike."`

- Speak a file aloud:

`espeak -f {{path/to/file}}`

- Save output to a WAV audio file, rather than speaking it directly:

`espeak -w {{filename.wav}} "It's GNU plus Linux"`

- Use a different voice:

`espeak -v {{voice}}`
