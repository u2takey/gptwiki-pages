# gh secret set

The `gh secret set` command is a command used in the GitHub CLI (Command-line interface) tool. This command is used to create or update a secret in the repository's secrets store. The secrets stored on GitHub includes passwords, API keys, and other confidential information that need to be encrypted and kept private.

The following is a detailed explanation of the different parts of the `gh secret set` command:

- `gh`: This is the main command for the GitHub CLI tool. This command is used to access different actions in the GitHub repository, such as creating issues, pull requests, and managing secrets.

- `secret`: This is a subcommand of the `gh` command, used specifically for managing secrets in GitHub.

- `set`: This is an argument used with the `secret` subcommand to set a new value to an existing secret or create a new secret. 

To use this command, you need to have the GitHub CLI installed and authenticated with GitHub. This command takes two mandatory arguments:

- `name`: This argument specifies the name of the secret you want to create or update. It should be a unique name within the repository.

- `value`: This argument specifies the value of the secret. The value can be any string or data type that needs to be kept secret.

Usage example:

`gh secret set MY_SECRET_TOKEN abc1234`

This command will create or update a secret with name `MY_SECRET_TOKEN` and set the value to `abc1234`. The secret will be securely stored in the GitHub repository and can be accessed by authorized actions or workflows.
