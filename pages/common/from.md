The `from` command is a keyword in many programming languages that allows you to import modules or objects from another file or package. 

When you use the `from` command in your program, you specify the name of the file or package you want to import from, and what exactly you want to import from that file or package. 

For instance, you can use the following syntax to import a specific function called `my_function` from a module called `my_module`:

```
from my_module import my_function
```

This command will make the `my_function` function available to use in your current program. 

You can also import an entire module or package using the `from` command, like this:

```
from my_module import *
```

This command will import all functions, classes, and other objects defined in `my_module`. However, this syntax is generally not recommended, as it can cause naming conflicts and make it harder to keep track of where different objects come from.

In summary, the `from` command is a useful feature in most programming languages that allows you to selectively import code from other files or packages, and integrate it into your own program.
