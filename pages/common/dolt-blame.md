The `dolt blame` command is a Git-like command in the Dolt database management system. This command is used to find out who last modified a specific line of code in a Dolt repository. This command is also known as `git blame` in Git.

The syntax of this command is simple—`dolt blame [path]`—where `[path]` is a path or file name that indicates the file to be analyzed. It shows the author name, the commit hash, and the timestamp of the last modification for each line of code in the specified file.

This command is particularly useful when trying to determine who made changes to a particular area of the code, or to track down the source of a bug or error. By using this command, developers can quickly identify which commit introduced a particular change or error and who made the change, making it easier to collaborate effectively and maintain code quality.

Overall, `dolt blame` is an essential command for Dolt developers who need to maintain and collaborate on complex databases, as it provides valuable insights into the history of code changes and can help pinpoint the source of issues.
