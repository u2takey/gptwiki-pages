# dvc commit 
## chatgpt 
`dvc commit` is a command used in Data Version Control (DVC) that commits changes made to data files and pipelines in a DVC project. 

When `dvc commit` is executed, DVC analyzes the tracked data files and pipelines for any modifications or updates. It then generates new data files or pipelines if necessary.

Once all updates and changes are complete, DVC automatically generates a Git commit for the data files and pipelines, similar to a traditional Git commit for source code. The commit message can be customized using the `-m` or `--message` option.

It is important to note that `dvc commit` only commits changes made to the data files and pipelines, not changes made to the code. It is recommended to use a separate Git repository for version controlling the code.

In summary, `dvc commit` is used to commit changes made to data files and pipelines in a DVC project, allowing for easy tracking and version control of data-driven projects.
