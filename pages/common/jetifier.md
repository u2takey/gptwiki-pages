Jetifier is a command-line tool that is used to modify an Android application's dependencies to use AndroidX libraries. AndroidX is an improvement to the original Android Support Library, which provides backwards-compatibility for newer Android features on older devices.

Before Jetifier, when migrating an Android app to AndroidX, all of the libraries that the app depended on would also need to be updated to use AndroidX libraries. This could be a time-consuming and error-prone process. Jetifier simplifies this migration process by automatically updating an app's dependencies to use AndroidX libraries.

To use Jetifier, you can run the following command:

`npx jetifier`

This command will modify the dependencies of your app to use AndroidX libraries. When using Jetifier, it's important to ensure that your app's code is also updated to use AndroidX APIs. Once your app's code is updated, you can build and run your app as normal.

Jetifier is included in Android Studio 3.2 and later, so you can also run Jetifier from within the Android Studio IDE. To do this, go to Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX, and select the "Jetify" option.
