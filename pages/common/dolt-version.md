## chatgpt 
The `dolt version` command is used to show the current version number of the Dolt database. 

When the `dolt` command is installed and used for the first time, it creates the `.dolt` directory in the user's home directory. This directory stores the current version number, among other things. Whenever a new version of Dolt is installed, the `.dolt` directory is updated with the new version number.

When the `dolt version` command is executed, it reads the version number from the `.dolt` directory and displays it on the console. This command is useful for checking which version of Dolt is currently installed and whether any updates are available. 

In addition to the version number, the `dolt version` command also displays information about the date and time of the latest commit to the Dolt repository, the Git commit hash for the Dolt version being used, and the operating system and architecture of the user's machine. 

Overall, the `dolt version` command is a simple and useful command for checking the Dolt version and related information.
