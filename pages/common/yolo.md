YOLO (You Only Look Once) is an object detection algorithm developed by Joseph Redmon and his team in 2016. It is a single-shot object detection algorithm that learns to recognize objects in images and videos through a single forward pass of a neural network. 

The YOLO algorithm works by breaking up an image into a grid of cells and predicts bounding boxes for each cell that contain objects. The algorithm then predicts the class probabilities for each object in the box and a confidence score estimated by the intersection over union (IoU) value between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. 

In practice, the YOLO algorithm can be used for many applications of object detection and recognition such as object counting, face detection, and autonomous driving. In terms of programming, the YOLO algorithm is implemented using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, and the user can utilize pre-trained models or train their own model with labeled data to achieve desired results.

- Create a copy of the default configuration in your current working directory:

`yolo task=init`

- Train the object detection, instance segment, or classification model with the specified configuration file:

`yolo task={{detect|segment|classify}} mode=train cfg={{path/to/config.yaml}}`
