Elinks is a text-based web browser that is used to browse the internet through the command line interface of a Linux or Unix-based operating system. When you type the command "elinks" in the terminal, it opens up the Elinks browser and shows you the ELinks start page, which contains a list of links to several popular websites such as Google, Wikipedia, and Reddit.

Elinks provides a range of features that allow you to browse the internet like a graphical browser, but with the speed and simplicity of a command line tool. Some of its key features include support for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and FTP, mouse support, tabbed browsing, bookmarks, history, and more.

To browse a specific website using Elinks, you can simply type the URL of the website in the Elinks bar and press Enter. Once the page loads, you can use the arrow keys or the mouse (if enabled) to navigate the page, click on links, and fill out forms. Elinks also allows you to view the page source, save the page to your computer, and even open multiple tabs to browse multiple websites at once.

Overall, Elinks is a powerful text-based web browser that is widely used by system administrators, programmers, and other power users who prefer working in the command line interface.
