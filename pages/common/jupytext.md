Jupytext is a command-line tool that enables Jupyter notebooks to be converted to and from several different formats, including plain text files (.md, .Rmd, .py, .ipynb) and various markup languages. This allows for greater flexibility and reproducibility in the sharing and collaboration of Jupyter notebooks among researchers, developers, and other stakeholders.

With Jupytext, you can use your preferred text editor or version control system to work with Jupyter notebooks in a plain text format, preserving your workflow and reducing the likelihood of version control conflicts. You can also use Jupytext to convert Jupyter notebooks to other formats, making it easier to share with colleagues who may not use Jupyter Notebooks or to integrate Jupyter notebooks into software projects.

The command "jupytext" is used to perform different actions on Jupyter notebooks, such as converting them to, from, or between different formats. For example, you can use the command "jupytext --to markdown notebook.ipynb" to convert a Jupyter notebook to markdown format, or "jupytext --sync notebook.ipynb" to synchronize changes made to a Jupyter notebook in plain text format back to the original .ipynb format. There are many other options and parameters you can use with jupytext, which can be found on their documentation webpage.

- Turn a notebook into a paired `.ipynb`/`.py` notebook:

`jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py {{notebook.ipynb}}`

- Convert a notebook to a `.py` file:

`jupytext --to py {{notebook.ipynb}}`

- Convert a `.py` file to a notebook with no outputs:

`jupytext --to notebook {{notebook.py}}`

- Convert a `.md` file to a notebook and run it:

`jupytext --to notebook --execute {{notebook.md}}`

- Update the input cells in a notebook and preserve outputs and metadata:

`jupytext --update --to notebook {{notebook.py}}`

- Update all paired representations of a notebook:

`jupytext --sync {{notebook.ipynb}}`
