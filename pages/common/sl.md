The "sl" command is a fun and harmless command found in Linux and Unix systems, which displays a graphic animation of a train running across the terminal window. 

The train hopefully means "steam locomotive" and the name "sl" comes from its resemblance to "ls", a widely used terminal command for listing files and directories.

The command can be executed simply by typing "sl" in the terminal and pressing enter. The train will then start moving across the screen, making a whistling sound as it goes. 

The "sl" command is often used playfully in order to trick users who are not paying close attention into thinking that they have typed "ls" incorrectly and are now seeing an error message.

While it has no functional purpose, it can be a fun way to add a touch of humor to a coding or terminal-based project, or to simply lighten the mood in a computer lab or office setting.
