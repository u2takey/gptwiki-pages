The `dotnet build` command is used to build a .NET Core or .NET Standard project. It is essentially a compilation process that produces an output assembly from the source files of a project. 

Here is a breakdown of the command:

1. `dotnet` - This is the command-line interface (CLI) for managing .NET applications and dependencies.

2. `build` - This is the command argument that tells the CLI to build a .NET project.

When you run the `dotnet build` command, the following actions are performed:

1. The project's dependencies are resolved and downloaded (if they are not already on the machine).

2. The compiler checks the syntax of the code and generates an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL) or Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL).

3. The intermediate language is then compiled into machine code specific to the operating system and processor architecture being used.

4. The output is then assembled into a .dll or .exe file that can be run on the corresponding platform.

In summary, `dotnet build` is a command-line tool that compiles and builds .NET projects into executable files.

- Compile the project or solution in the current directory:

`dotnet build`

- Compile a .NET project or solution in debug mode:

`dotnet build {{path/to/project_or_solution}}`

- Compile in release mode:

`dotnet build --configuration {{Release}}`

- Compile without restoring dependencies:

`dotnet build --no-restore`

- Compile with a specific verbosity level:

`dotnet build --verbosity {{quiet|minimal|normal|detailed|diagnostic}}`

- Compile for a specific runtime:

`dotnet build --runtime {{runtime_identifier}}`

- Specify the output directory:

`dotnet build --output {{path/to/directory}}`
