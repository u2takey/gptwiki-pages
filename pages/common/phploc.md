The `phploc` command is a tool that allows you to analyze a PHP project's size, including details such as lines of code, number of files, and cyclomatic complexity. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the command means:

- `phploc` - This is the name of the command you will run in your terminal or command prompt. It requires PHP to be installed on your system.
- `[directory]` - This is the path to the directory you want to analyze. You can specify a relative or absolute path.
- `[--count-tests]` - This is an option that tells `phploc` to count the lines of code in test files as well as regular files. If you include this option, `phploc` will provide a more complete analysis of your project's size.
- `[--progress]` - This is an option that tells `phploc` to display a progress bar while it's running. This can be helpful if you're analyzing a large project and want to know how much time is left.

When you run the `phploc` command with a directory argument, it will analyze all the PHP files in that directory and provide a detailed report on the size of the project. This can be useful for understanding how much code is involved in a project, which can help with planning and estimating future work.

- Analyze a directory and print the result:

`phploc {{path/to/directory}}`

- Include only specific files from a comma-separated list (globs are allowed):

`phploc {{path/to/directory}} --names {{files}}`

- Exclude specific files from a comma-separated list (globs are allowed):

`phploc {{path/to/directory}} --names-exclude {{files}}`

- Exclude a specific directory from analysis:

`phploc {{path/to/directory}} --exclude {{path/to/exclude_directory}}`

- Log the results to a specific CSV file:

`phploc {{path/to/directory}} --log-csv {{path/to/file}}`

- Log the results to a specific XML file:

`phploc {{path/to/directory}} --log-xml {{path/to/file}}`

- Count PHPUnit test case classes and test methods:

`phploc {{path/to/directory}} --count-tests`
