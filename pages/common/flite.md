Flite is a command-line program used for text-to-speech (TTS) processing. It is designed to convert written text into audible speech, and it uses a synthesized voice to deliver the spoken output.

The flite command is used to specify the text that needs to be converted to speech, and it supports various options and parameters that control aspects of the speech output such as voice, speed, and volume. The basic syntax of the flite command is:

```
flite [options] [input_text]
```

where `[options]` represent one or more command-line options that can be used to customize the audio output, and `[input_text]` represents the input text that needs to be converted to speech.

Some common options that can be used with the flite command include:

- `-voice voice_name`: Specifies the name of the voice to be used for audio output. Flite supports multiple synthesizer voices, and this option allows you to switch between them.
- `-f input_file`: Specifies the name of the text file containing the text to be converted to speech. This is an alternative to passing the input text as a command-line parameter.
- `-o output_file`: Specifies the name of the file where the audio output will be written. By default, the output is written to the standard output stream.

Here's an example of using the flite command to convert a text file to speech:

```
flite -voice rms -f my_text_file.txt
```

This command specifies the `-voice` option to use the "rms" voice for audio output, and the `-f` option to specify that the text to be converted to speech is contained in the file `my_text_file.txt`. Flite will then generate audio output of the specified text using the selected voice and write the output to the standard output stream.
