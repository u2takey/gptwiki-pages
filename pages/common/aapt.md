Some common aapt commands used in Android development includes:

1. aapt package

3. aapt dump

4. aapt add
This command helps in package management by allowing you to add or delete specific resources from the APK file, such as audio or video resources or manifest files. 

The aapt tool is an essential part of the Android development process as it helps in managing and manipulating the resources of an app, so it is ready for the various Android devices with different screen sizes and capacities.
