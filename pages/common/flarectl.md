As an AI language model, I do not have direct access to command-line tools like flarectl, but I can give information on what it usually refers to.

Flarectl is a command-line interface (CLI) tool used for Cloudflare's edge computing platform, Cloudflare Workers. It is designed to help developers manage and deploy their Cloudflare Workers code and related resources.

There are several subcommands within the flarectl tool, each with a specific purpose:

- `init`: Initializes a new Cloudflare Workers project in the current directory.
- `deploy`: Deploys the code in the current directory as a Cloudflare Worker.
- `preview`: Preview the code changes that will be deployed to Cloudflare Workers.
- `logs`: Fetches and displays logs generated by a Cloudflare Worker.
- `kv`: Interact with Cloudflare Workers KV (Key-Value) storage solutions.
- `worker`: Interact with information about a specific worker.

Overall, flarectl helps automate the deployment process and helps developers manage their Cloudflare Workers more efficiently.
