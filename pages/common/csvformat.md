The `csvformat` command is a command-line tool that is used to format CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. The command takes a CSV file and applies a specific formatting scheme to transform it into a desired format. The tool allows users to customize certain aspects related to the input CSV file such as changing the delimiter, adding/removing columns, and changing field order. 

Some of the commonly used options with `csvformat` are:

- `-d, --delimiter=DELIM`: Used to specify the delimiter character used in the input CSV file. By default, a comma is used as the delimiter. 
- `-D, --out-delimiter=DELIM`: Used to specify the delimiter character to be used in the output formatted CSV file.
- `-H, --no-header-row`: Used to specify that the input CSV file does not contain a header row. This can be useful if the first line of your input file is not a header.
- `-v, --verbose`: Used to display a detailed log of the formatting process.

Here is an example usage of the `csvformat` command:

```
csvformat -d ',' -D '|' -H input.csv > output.txt
```

In this example, the command is using the input CSV file called `input.csv` with the delimiter character `,` and is transforming it into an output format where the delimiter character is changed to `|`. The output is being redirected to a file called `output.txt`. Additionally, the `-H` option is being used to specify that the input CSV file does not contain a header row.
