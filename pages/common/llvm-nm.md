The `llvm-nm` command is a tool in the LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) toolchain that is used to inspect the symbol table of an object file or an executable file. 

When you compile a C/C++ code using a compiler like GCC or Clang, it creates an object file (.o) that contains machine code and symbols that link the code together. Similarly, when you link multiple object files together, you get an executable file that contains symbols that link the code from all the object files.

The `llvm-nm` command can be used to view the symbols present in these files. It takes one or more object or executable files as input and outputs a list of symbols that are defined in the file. The symbols can include function names, global and static variables, and object names. 

The `llvm-nm` command supports several different output formats, including:

1. The traditional Unix `nm` format, which displays the symbol name, type, and value in hexadecimal format.
2. The Mach-O format, which is used on macOS and iOS, and displays additional information such as the symbol section and flags.
3. The COFF format, which is used on Windows, and displays the symbol name, value, and section.

Overall, the `llvm-nm` command is a powerful tool that can help you understand the symbols defined in your code, diagnose link errors, and inspect compiled code.
