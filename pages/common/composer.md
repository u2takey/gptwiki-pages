Composer is a command-line tool that is used for dependency management in PHP. It is used to install and manage third-party libraries or packages that are required for our PHP application development.

Here are some of the essential composer commands:

1. `composer init`: This command is used to initialize a new composer package. It will ask for package details like name, description, author, etc.

2. `composer install`: This command is used to install all dependencies listed in the composer.json file in the project directory.

3. `composer update`: This command is used to update all the dependencies listed in the composer.json file in the project directory.

4. `composer require`: This command is used to add specific packages to our PHP project.

5. `composer remove`: This command is used to remove specific packages from our PHP project.

6. `composer dump-autoload`: This command is used to regenerate the autoloader file, which is used for automatically loading the required classes.

7. `composer show`: This command is used to list all the installed packages.

8. `composer search`: This command is used to search for available packages on the Packagist repository.

In summary, composer is a command-line tool that helps manage dependencies in our PHP projects by handling package installation, upgrades, and autoloading.

`composer install`

- Uninstall a package from this project, removing it as a dependency from `composer.json`:

`composer remove {{user/package_name}}`

- Update all the dependencies in this project's `composer.json` and note versions in `composer.lock` file:

`composer update`

- Update composer lock only after updating `composer.json` manually:

`composer update --lock`
