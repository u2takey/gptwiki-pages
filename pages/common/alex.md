As an AI language model, I am not sure in what context you are trying to use the term "alex". It could be a name of a person or a command on a specific platform.

If you are referring to "alex" as a command in any programming language; it is not a recognized command. Commands usually have a specific syntax and functionality in programming languages. Hence, it is important to specify the context to explain the command in detail.
