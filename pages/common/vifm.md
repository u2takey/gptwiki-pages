Vifm is a text-based file manager for Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to navigate and manage the files and directories on their system through a terminal interface. The vifm command starts the file manager, launching a new terminal window with the vifm interface. Once running, users can use keyboard commands to perform various file management tasks, such as browsing directories, copying and moving files, searching for files, creating new directories, and deleting files. Vifm also provides customizable key bindings and a variety of configuration options for advanced users.
