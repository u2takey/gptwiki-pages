The `git update-ref` command is used to update the object name that a reference points to. 

In Git, a reference is a pointer to a commit or another reference. Branches, tags, and HEAD are some examples of references. Each reference is associated with a unique object name, which is the SHA-1 hash ID of a Git object.

The basic syntax of the `git update-ref` command is:

```
git update-ref <refname> <newvalue> [<oldvalue>] [-m <reason>]
```

Where:
- `refname` is the name of the reference to be updated.
- `newvalue` is the new object name that the reference should point to.
- `oldvalue` is the old object name that the reference currently points to. This argument is optional and can be used to ensure atomicity in case multiple concurrent updates happen on the same reference.
- `-m <reason>` is an optional message to be associated with the update.

For example, to update the master branch to point to a new commit with the object name `abc123`, you can use the following command:

```
git update-ref refs/heads/master abc123
```

If you want to make sure that nobody else has updated the master branch before you, you can also specify the old object name as follows:

```
git update-ref refs/heads/master abc123 def456
```

This will only update the reference if its current value is `def456`. 

Note that the `git update-ref` command can be dangerous if used improperly, as it can cause Git to lose track of commits and other objects. Therefore, it should be used with caution, and preferably only by experienced Git users.

- Delete a ref, useful for soft resetting the first commit:

`git update-ref -d {{HEAD}}`

- Update ref with a message:

`git update-ref -m {{message}} {{HEAD}} {{4e95e05}}`
