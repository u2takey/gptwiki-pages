The "ccomps" command is a part of the Graphviz suite of tools, which is used for visualizing and manipulating graphs. The command is used to extract the connected components of a given graph, where a connected component is defined as a set of vertices that are connected to each other by edges. 

The syntax for the ccomps command is:

ccomps [options] input_file [output_file]

Here, the "input_file" argument specifies the file name of the input graph in DOT format, and the optional "output_file" argument specifies the file name where the output graph will be written in DOT format. If no output file is specified, the command will write the output to the standard output stream.

The options that can be used with the ccomps command are:

- -x: Causes the output to be in an extended format that includes extra information about the connectivity of the graph.
- -m: Marks each node in the output graph with its component number.
- -s: Sorts the output components by size, with the largest component first.

When the ccomps command is executed, it reads the input graph from the specified file and applies a graph algorithm to extract the connected components of the graph. The command then generates the output graph in DOT format, where each component is represented as a subgraph with a unique label. If the -m option is used, each node in the output graph is marked with its component number. The -s option sorts the output components by their size, with the largest component appearing first. If the -x option is used, the output includes additional information about the connectivity of the graph, such as the number of edges and the number of nodes in each component.

Overall, the ccomps command is a useful tool for analyzing the connectivity of graphs, particularly large and complex networks. It can help researchers to identify clusters of vertices that are tightly interconnected, which can provide insights into the structure and function of the underlying system.

- Decompose one or more graphs into their connected components:

`ccomps {{path/to/input1.gv}} {{path/to/input2.gv ...}} > {{path/to/output.gv}}`

- Print the number of nodes, edges, and connected components in one or more graphs:

`ccomps -v -s {{path/to/input1.gv}} {{path/to/input2.gv ...}}`

- Write each connected component to numbered filenames based on `output.gv`:

`ccomps -x -o {{path/to/output.gv}} {{path/to/input1.gv}} {{path/to/input2.gv ...}}`

- Display help for `ccomps`:

`ccomps -?`
