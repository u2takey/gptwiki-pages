The `unlink` command is a Unix-based command-line utility that is used to remove or delete a single file or symbolic link. Here is a detailed explanation of its features and how to use it:

Syntax:
The basic syntax of the `unlink` command is:

`unlink [options] filename`

Options:
The `unlink` command supports the following options:

- `-f`: Force deletion without prompting for confirmation.
- `-i`: Prompt for confirmation before deleting.
- `-v`: Print a verbose output for each file that is deleted.

Examples:

1. To delete a file named `file1.txt` without being prompted for confirmation, use the following command:

   `unlink -f file1.txt`

2. To delete a file named `file2.txt` with a prompt for confirmation, use the following command:

   `unlink -i file2.txt`

3. To delete a file named `file3.txt` and show a verbose output, use the following command:

   `unlink -v file3.txt`

4. To delete a symbolic link named `symlink1` without being prompted for confirmation, use the following command:

   `unlink -f symlink1`

Note: The `unlink` command does not work with directories. To delete a directory and its contents, use the `rm` command.
