The 'virsh-undefine' command in the context of virtualization management is used to remove or undefine a virtual machine (VM) from the hypervisor. Here is a detailed explanation of the command:

1. What is virsh-undefine command?
The 'virsh-undefine' command is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that is used to remove or delete a virtual machine definition from the hypervisor. The command is used in the KVM, Xen, and LXC virtualization environments.

2. Syntax
The syntax of the command is as follows:
virsh undefine [OPTIONS] domain-XML

Here, 'OPTIONS' are the additional arguments that can be passed to the command to modify its behavior. 'domain-XML' is the path to the XML file that defines the virtual machine.

3. How does it work?
When you run the 'virsh-undefine' command, it will remove the virtual machine configuration from the hypervisor but will leave the virtual disk image unaffected. This means that the virtual machine's OS and any data stored on the virtual disk image will still exist on the storage device.

4. Options
Some of the commonly used options with the command are:

- --remove-all-storage: This option will remove all virtual disk images associated with the virtual machine.
- --managed-save: This option will attempt to save the VM state before undefining it.
- --snapshots-metadata: This option will remove all the snapshot metadata.

5. Examples
Here are some sample commands that use the 'virsh-undefine' command:

- To remove a virtual machine definition:
virsh undefine my-vm

- To remove a virtual machine definition and its associated disk image:
virsh undefine --remove-all-storage my-vm

- To remove a virtual machine definition and its associated snapshots:
virsh undefine --snapshots-metadata my-vm

Overall, the virsh-undefine command is a powerful tool that can help remove an unwanted VM definition from the hypervisor without affecting the underlying virtual disk image or the OS installed on it.

- Delete only the virtual machine configuration file:

`virsh undefine --domain {{vm_name}}`

- Delete the configuration file and all associated storage volumes:

`virsh undefine --domain {{vm_name}} --remove-all-storage`

- Delete the configuration file and the specified storage volumes using the target name or the source name (as obtained from the `virsh domblklist` command):

`virsh undefine --domain {{vm_name}} --storage {{sda,path/to/source}}`
