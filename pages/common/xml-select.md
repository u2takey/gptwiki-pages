"xml select" is not a specific command, rather it is a general concept related to selecting XML data using various methods. 

XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a programming language designed for storing and transmitting data that is structured hierarchically. XML allows developers to create their own specific tags and attributes to define their data, making it easily readable by machines and humans alike.

When dealing with XML data, one of the most essential tasks is selecting specific elements or attributes from the XML document. This is where "xml select" comes into play.

There are different ways to select XML elements, depending on the programming language, framework, or API that you are using. Some common methods include:

1. Using XPath: XPath is a query language that allows you to navigate and select XML data based on the pattern of the elements and attributes. With XPath, you can select elements based on their name, attribute values, child elements, and more.

2. Using XQuery: XQuery is another query language that allows you to extract and transform XML data using XML Path Language (XPath) expressions.

3. Using DOM (Document Object Model) methods: DOM is a platform- and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of XML documents. With DOM methods, you can traverse the XML document and select elements using their node name, node type, or other properties.

4. Using SAX (Simple API for XML) events: SAX is a streaming API that parses an XML document from beginning to end, generating events as it encounters the different parts of the document. With SAX, you can handle events for specific XML elements or attributes as they are encountered in the XML stream.

In summary, "xml select" is a general term referring to selecting XML data using different methods and querying languages. The specific method used will depend on the programming language and framework being used, as well as the preferences and requirements of the developer.

- Select all elements matching "XPATH1" and print the value of their sub-element "XPATH2":

`xml select --template --match "{{XPATH1}}" --value-of "{{XPATH2}}" {{path/to/input.xml|URI}}`

- Match  "XPATH1" and print the value of "XPATH2" as text with new-lines:

`xml select --text --template --match "{{XPATH1}}" --value-of "{{XPATH2}}" --nl {{path/to/input.xml|URI}}`

- Count the elements of "XPATH1":

`xml select --template --value-of "count({{XPATH1}})" {{path/to/input.xml|URI}}`

- Count all nodes in one or more XML documents:

`xml select --text --template --inp-name --output " " --value-of "count(node())" --nl {{path/to/input1.xml|URI}} {{path/to/input2.xml|URI}}`

- Display help for the `select` subcommand:

`xml select --help`
