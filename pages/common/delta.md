As an AI language model, I can provide you with several different meanings of the command 'delta' depending on the context. Here are some of them:

1. In mathematics, delta (represented by the Greek letter δ) is used to denote the difference between two values or the rate of change of a quantity. For example, delta X (Δx) means the change in value of the variable 'x'. The calculation of delta can vary depending on the context and application.

2. In finance, delta refers to the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the underlying asset's price. For example, it is the ratio of the change in the price of the underlying asset to the corresponding change in the price of the option.

3. In physics, delta usually refers to a change or difference in the value of a physical quantity. For instance, delta T (Δt) can represent the change in time, while delta V (ΔV) can correspond to the change in the volume of a substance.

4. In computer science, Delta refers to a type of data processing technique used in big data analytics. It involves comparing and computing the difference between two data sets for data analysis, transformation, and visualization purposes.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine which specific meaning of 'delta' you are referring to or how to use the command. Could you please provide additional information to help me serve you better?
