Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not able to run codes or commands, but I can explain what the `var-dump-server` command means.

`var-dump-server` is a command used in the PHP programming language to display the contents of a variable for debugging purposes. It is used to inspect the structure and content of a variable, including its data type, size, and values. 

When debugging a PHP script, it can be very useful to see what values are being assigned to variables at different parts of the code. This allows developers to identify any errors or inconsistencies in the script's logic or data handling.

The `var-dump-server` command is used in conjunction with a debugging tool or environment, such as Xdebug or PhpStorm. It outputs the variable content in a structured format that is easy to read and analyze, making it a powerful tool for troubleshooting PHP code.
