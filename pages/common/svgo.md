SVGO is a command-line tool that is used to optimize SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files. It stands for "SVG Optimizer" and is designed to reduce the file size of SVG images while preserving their quality.

The command "svgo" is used to invoke the SVGO tool. When you run the "svgo" command with a specified SVG file, SVGO will analyze the file and apply a series of optimization techniques to reduce its size.

Some of the techniques used by SVGO include:

1. Removing unnecessary metadata and comments
2. Minimizing and simplifying the SVG code
3. Removing duplicate or redundant information
4. Transforming shapes and paths to reduce the number of nodes
5. Converting gradients and patterns to simpler forms
6. Removing invisible or hidden elements
7. Compressing colors and applying other color optimizations

When you run the SVGO command, it will output an optimized SVG file. You can specify various options and flags with the command to customize the optimization process.

Overall, the "svgo" command is a powerful tool for reducing the size of SVG files and improving their performance on websites and other digital platforms.

- Optimize a file using the default plugins (overwrites the original file):

`svgo {{test.svg}}`

- Optimize a file and save the result to another file:

`svgo {{test.svg}} -o {{test.min.svg}}`

- Optimize all SVG files within a directory (overwrites the original files):

`svgo -f {{path/to/directory/with/svg/files}}`

- Optimize all SVG files within a directory and save the resulting files to another directory:

`svgo -f {{path/to/input/directory}} -o {{path/to/output/directory}}`

- Optimize SVG content passed from another command, and save the result to a file:

`{{cat test.svg}} | svgo -i - -o {{test.min.svg}}`

- Optimize a file and print out the result:

`svgo {{test.svg}} -o -`

- Show available plugins:

`svgo --show-plugins`
