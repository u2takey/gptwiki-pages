The `go fmt` command is a tool in the Go programming language that is used for formatting Go source code. The command can be used to automatically reformat the code to conform to the Go language specification's formatting standards.

When executed, `go fmt` will go through all the files within the current directory, and if any of the files need formatting adjustments, they will be automatically reformatted as per Go's official formatting standards. Go fmt also provides support for custom formatting options via the use of directives within comments.

This command is beneficial in ensuring that code written by different developers adheres to a consistent style, making it easier to read, review, and maintain in the future. Additionally, using Go fmt can prevent potential errors that may occur due to inconsistent formatting of the code.

Overall, `go fmt` is a powerful and efficient tool that helps ensure that Go code remains both readable and maintainable.
