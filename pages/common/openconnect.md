The `openconnect` command is a type of VPN (Virtual Private Network) client software that allows users to securely connect to a remote network over the internet. It is an open-source alternative to proprietary VPN clients like Cisco AnyConnect.

When executed, the `openconnect` command prompts the user to enter the remote VPN server address and their login credentials. Once validated, the client establishes a secure tunnel between the user's computer and the remote network, allowing the user to access resources on that network as if they were physically present in the same location.

`Openconnect` supports various VPN protocol standards such as SSL, TLS, DTLS, and ESP, and can work with both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. It can be used on different operating systems, including Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, and macOS.

Overall, `openconnect` is a powerful command-line tool for secure remote connectivity that can provide businesses and individuals with an added layer of security and privacy when online.
