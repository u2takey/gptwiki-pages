OMF stands for Object Module Format. It is a file format used for object code, which is machine-readable code generated by a compiler from source code. 

The "omf" command is not a standalone command. Rather, it is a file format used by compilers, assemblers, and linkers. 

Depending on the context, "omf" may refer to a command-line option that indicates the compiler or linker should use the OMF format when generating object code or linking object files. For example, in the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, the "/FA" option generates an assembly listing file in OMF format.

In summary, the "omf" command is not a command in itself, but rather a file format used by compilers, assemblers, and linkers to generate and work with object code.
