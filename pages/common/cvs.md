CVS stands for Concurrent Versions System. It is a version control system that enables developers to store and manage different versions of their code in a centralized repository. 

With the CVS command, developers can perform tasks such as checking out code, committing changes, updating code, and resolving conflicts. Here are some common CVS commands:

- cvs checkout: This command allows a developer to download a working copy of the source code from the repository to their local machine.

- cvs add: This command tells CVS to add a new file to the repository.

- cvs commit: This command updates the repository with changes made to a file or set of files.

- cvs update: This command updates the local copy of the source code with any changes made by other developers in the repository.

- cvs status: This command shows the current status of files in the repository, including whether they've been modified or deleted.

- cvs log: This command displays a log of all changes made to a file, including who made the change and when.

Overall, CVS is a powerful tool for managing code in a team environment and ensuring that everyone has access to the latest code changes.
