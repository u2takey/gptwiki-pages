## chatgpt 
The `vimtutor` command opens a built-in interactive tutorial for Vim, a highly configurable text editor that has been around since the 1990s. Vim is known for its powerful editing features, such as jumping to specific characters, undoing and redoing changes, and performing complex text operations.

The `vimtutor` tutorial walks users through the basics of using Vim, including how to open and save files, navigate within files, edit text, perform search and replace operations, and configure settings. The tutorial consists of a series of lessons that are presented in a terminal window, with users typing in commands and making changes to text files as they go.

The tutorial is self-paced, allowing users to work through each lesson at their own speed. It is designed to be hands-on, so users can expect to spend most of their time actually using Vim rather than just reading about it.

Overall, `vimtutor` is a great way to get started with Vim, whether you are new to the editor or just need a refresher on its features.
