# zlib-flate

zlib-flate is a command-line program that performs lossless data compression and decompression using the zlib library. It is typically used in Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux and macOS.

The zlib library uses the Deflate algorithm to compress data, which is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. This algorithm looks for repeated sequences of data and replaces them with a reference to the previous occurrence of the same sequence. This allows for significant reduction in the size of the data without loss of information.

To use zlib-flate, the command syntax is as follows:

zlib-flate [-cdfvz] [file]

The command can take several optional flags:

- "-c" writes the output to standard output instead of a file.
- "-d" performs decompression instead of compression.
- "-f" forces compression of files that are not regular files, such as directories.
- "-v" produces verbose output, indicating the number of bytes compressed or decompressed.
- "-z" produces compressed output even if the compressed file is larger than the input file.

The command requires a file name or input from standard input. If the input file is specified as "-" (a hyphen), it reads from standard input.

An example of compressing a file with zlib-flate is:

zlib-flate -c myfile.txt > myfile.txt.gz

This command compresses the contents of an input file "myfile.txt" and writes the compressed output to "myfile.txt.gz". The "-c" flag writes output to standard output, which is then redirected to the compressed file.

Similarly, to decompress a file, the following command can be used:

zlib-flate -d myfile.txt.gz > myfile.txt

This command decompresses the contents of a compressed input file "myfile.txt.gz" and writes the decompressed output to "myfile.txt". The "-d" flag performs decompression instead of compression.

- Compress a file:

`zlib-flate -compress < {{path/to/input_file}} > {{path/to/compressed.zlib}}`

- Uncompress a file:

`zlib-flate -uncompress < {{path/to/compressed.zlib}} > {{path/to/output_file}}`

- Compress a file with a specified compression level. 0=Fastest (Worst), 9=Slowest (Best):

`zlib-flate -compress={{compression_level}} < {{path/to/input_file}} > {{path/to/compressed.zlib}}`
