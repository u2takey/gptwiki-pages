csvsql is a command-line tool that allows you to easily query and manipulate CSV (Comma-Separated Value) files using SQL (Structured Query Language) syntax.

This command can be used to transform CSV files into a database, to create and manage tables, to filter data, to join tables, to perform calculations, and to aggregate data.

The basic syntax of csvsql command is:

csvsql [OPTIONS] [FILENAME]

The OPTIONS parameter specifies various options such as the delimiter character, the encoding, the output format, and the SQL engine. Some of the most commonly used options are:

- -d or --delimiter: Specifies the character used to separate fields in the CSV file (default is comma).
- -e or --encoding: Specifies the character encoding of the CSV file (default is utf-8).
- -i or --no-inference: Disables the automatic inference of column types from the header row.
- -k or --key: Specifies the column(s) to use as primary key(s) when creating tables.
- -q or --quotechar: Specifies the character used to quote fields containing special characters (default is double quote).
- -t or --tables: Specifies the name(s) of the table(s) to create.
- -x or --skipinitialspace: Skips leading whitespaces after the delimiter.

The FILENAME parameter specifies the path to the CSV file to be processed. This file can be read from the local filesystem, from a remote URL or from the standard input/output streams.

Once the command is executed, csvsql reads the CSV file and generates an SQL script that can be executed by a SQL engine (such as SQLite or MySQL) to perform the desired operations.

For example, the following command creates a table named "students" with columns "id", "name", and "age" from a CSV file named "students.csv":

csvsql --table students --no-inference --key id students.csv

This command disables the auto-inference of column types and specifies the "id" column as the primary key.

Once the table is created, you can perform various SQL queries on the data using commands like SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE. For example:

SELECT name, age FROM students WHERE age > 20;

This command selects the names and ages of all students older than 20 from the "students" table.

- Generate a `CREATE TABLE` SQL statement for a CSV file:

`csvsql {{path/to/data.csv}}`

- Import a CSV file into an SQL database:

`csvsql --insert --db "{{mysql://user:password@host/database}}" {{data.csv}}`

- Run an SQL query on a CSV file:

`csvsql --query "{{select * from 'data'}}" {{data.csv}}`
