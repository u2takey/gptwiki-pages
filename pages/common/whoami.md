The "whoami" command is a Unix/Linux command that simply prints the name of the current user or the username of the user who is currently logged in. 

When you execute the "whoami" command, the system queries the currently logged-in user's identity and then displays that information to the user. This command is used when you need to confirm your user identity before performing any tasks that need specific user privileges. 

In summary, executing the "whoami" command will display the username of the current user who is executing the command.
