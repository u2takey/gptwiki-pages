The command "tlmgr gui" is used in the TeX Live distribution to launch the graphical user interface (GUI) of the TeX Live Manager. This allows users to manage their TeX Live installation using a user-friendly interface with buttons and checkboxes, rather than using command-line tools.

When the "tlmgr gui" command is entered in the command prompt or terminal, a window will open on the screen displaying several tabs with options for managing the TeX Live installation. Some of the available options include:

- Update: This tab allows users to update their TeX Live installation to the latest version available on the internet.

- Install: This tab allows users to install new packages, fonts, or extensions for TeX Live.

- Remove: This tab allows users to remove packages, fonts, or extensions that are no longer needed.

- Settings: This tab allows users to change various settings related to their TeX Live installation, such as proxy settings, package repositories, and update frequency.

Using the "tlmgr gui" command is an alternative to using command-line tools like "tlmgr update", "tlmgr install", and "tlmgr remove". For users who prefer a graphical interface, the TeX Live Manager GUI is a convenient way to manage their TeX Live installation without having to memorize command-line arguments or navigate complex directories.
