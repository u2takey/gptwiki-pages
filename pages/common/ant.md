`ant` is a command used in software development to build Java-based projects using the Apache Ant build tool. When you run the `ant` command in the terminal or command prompt, it reads the project's `build.xml` file, which specifies how the project should be built, and executes the specified tasks.

Ant provides a set of built-in tasks such as compiling Java code, running tests, packaging binaries, and generating documentation for the project. However, it is also possible to define custom tasks specific to the project's requirements.

When the `ant` command is run, it first checks if the necessary dependencies are present, and if not, downloads them automatically. Then it proceeds to execute the tasks defined in the `build.xml` file, in the order specified.

The output of the `ant` command is usually a summary of the build process, including any errors or warnings that occurred during the build. It provides project developers with insight into the progress of the build and its results.

Overall, the `ant` command is a powerful tool for building and managing Java-based projects, allowing developers to automate build processes, improve efficiency, and reduce errors.

- Build a project using build file other than `build.xml`:

`ant -f {{buildfile.xml}}`

- Print information on possible targets for this project:

`ant -p`

- Print debugging information:

`ant -d`

- Execute all targets that do not depend on fail target(s):

`ant -k`
