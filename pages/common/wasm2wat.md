The "wasm2wat" command is a tool that is used for converting a binary WebAssembly file (.wasm) into a text-based representation using WebAssembly Text Format (WAT).

WebAssembly is a low-level binary language that is designed to run on the web, and it is not always easy to read or understand the code in its binary format. WAT, on the other hand, is a text-based format that is more human-readable and can be useful for debugging and understanding the WebAssembly code.

The "wasm2wat" command converts the binary WebAssembly file into the WAT format by parsing the binary file and generating a text-based representation. The resulting text file is similar to a source code file, with readable text representing the various instructions, functions, and variables of the WebAssembly program.

One of the advantages of using the "wasm2wat" command is that it allows developers to examine the WebAssembly code in more detail, making it easier to understand how the code works and to debug any issues that may arise. Additionally, the WAT format can be useful for communicating with other developers about the code or for version control purposes.

Overall, the "wasm2wat" command is a useful tool for developers who work with WebAssembly programs and need to convert binary code into a more readable format.

- Convert a file to the text format and display it to the console:

`wasm2wat {{file.wasm}}`

- Write the output to a given file:

`wasm2wat {{file.wasm}} -o {{file.wat}}`
