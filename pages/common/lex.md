The `lex` command is used to generate lexical analyzers or tokenizers for programming languages or other structured input languages. The command takes as input a set of rules written in a specialized language called regular expressions, which describe patterns that should be matched in the input text. The lex command then generates a C program that can read the input text, identify tokens based on the regular expression patterns, and take some action based on the tokens that have been identified. 

In other words, the `lex` command is a tool for building scanners or tokenizers that can be used to process input text into individual words or tokens that can be further analyzed or processed by a program. The `lex` command is commonly used in the development of compilers, interpreters, and other tools for working with programming languages or other structured data formats.

- Generate an analyzer from a Lex file:

`lex {{analyzer.l}}`

- Specify the output file:

`lex {{analyzer.l}} --outfile {{analyzer.c}}`

- Compile a C file generated by Lex:

`cc {{path/to/lex.yy.c}} --output {{executable}}`
