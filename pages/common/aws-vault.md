aws-vault is a command-line tool that provides an encrypted vault for storing and managing AWS access credentials. It is designed to help users securely manage access keys, session tokens, and other AWS credentials, while also simplifying the process of accessing AWS resources.

The aws-vault command-line tool can be used to create, store, and manage AWS credentials, and is compatible with a wide range of AWS services and tools. It provides features such as multi-factor authentication and automatic session expiration, which helps to ensure that AWS credentials remain secure and in compliance with security standards.

One of the main benefits of using aws-vault is that it helps to prevent the accidental exposure of AWS credentials, which can lead to security breaches and other security-related issues. By encrypting and storing AWS credentials in a secure vault, users can more easily manage and protect their AWS access keys, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

The aws-vault command-line tool can be installed on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. Once installed, users can use the command-line interface to create, view, and modify AWS credentials as needed. Additionally, the tool can be integrated with other AWS command-line tools and scripts, providing a more streamlined and efficient method for managing AWS resources.
