svn is a command-line tool used for version control within the context of the Apache Subversion software project. svn is short for "Subversion". 

Subversion is a centralized version control system, which means it's a system that allows multiple developers to work on the same project without interfering with each other's changes. This is achieved by keeping track of all changes made to the software in a central repository. Individual developers can work on their own copies, make changes, and then commit their changes back to the repository, which will then update the entire project.

The svn command is used to execute subversion commands from the command line. Here are some of the most commonly used options when using svn:

- checkout: download a copy of a repository, or a specific folder within a repository, to your local machine. This sets up a working copy of the code, allowing you to make changes and commit them back to the repository.
- update: download changes that have been made to a repository to your local machine. This is useful if other members of your team have made changes to the code that you need to incorporate into your local version.
- commit: upload changes made to your local copy of the code back to the repository. This makes your changes available to others on your team.
- add: add new files to the repository.
- log: view a log of changes made to a repository.
- status: see which files have been added, modified, or deleted in your local copy of the code.

There are many additional options available within svn, such as branching, merging, and tagging, which allow for more complex version control operations.

- Check out a working copy from a repository:

`svn co {{url/to/repository}}`

- Bring changes from the repository into the working copy:

`svn up`

- Put files and directories under version control, scheduling them for addition to repository. They will be added in next commit:

`svn add {{PATH}}`

- Send changes from your working copy to the repository:

`svn ci -m {{commit_log_message}} [{{PATH}}]`

- Display changes from the last 10 revisions, showing modified files for each revision:

`svn log -vl {{10}}`

- Show detailed help:

`svn help`
