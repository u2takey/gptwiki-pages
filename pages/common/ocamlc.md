The `ocamlc` command is used to compile OCaml source code into bytecode that can be run on a computer. It is a compiler for the OCaml programming language. 

When executed, the `ocamlc` command takes a number of source files (with `.ml` extensions) and compiles them into executable bytecode files (with `.cmo` or `.cmx` extensions), or object files (with `.o` extension) that can be linked together with other object files to create a binary executable. 

In order to compile your code using `ocamlc`, you will need to specify the input files that you want to compile as arguments to the command, along with any necessary options. The output files will be created in the same directory as the input files, unless you specify otherwise.

Some common options that can be used with `ocamlc` include: 

- `-o <output_file>`: specifies the name of the output file to be created.
- `-c`: tells `ocamlc` to only compile the source code into object files and not link them.
- `-g`: generates debugging information for the compiled code.
- `-w <warning_options>`: enables or disables specific compiler warnings.

Overall, `ocamlc` is an important command for OCaml developers who want to compile their code into executable or object files that can be run on a computer.

- Create a binary from a source file:

`ocamlc {{path/to/source_file.ml}}`

- Create a named binary from a source file:

`ocamlc -o {{path/to/binary}} {{path/to/source_file.ml}}`

- Automatically generate a module signature (interface) file:

`ocamlc -i {{path/to/source_file.ml}}`
