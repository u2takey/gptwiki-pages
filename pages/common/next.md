The `next` command is a keyword used in various programming languages, including Python, to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next one. 

In Python, it is used in conjunction with a `for` or `while` loop to skip the current iteration and immediately move to the next one. This is often useful when certain conditions need to be met before executing the remaining statements in the current iteration.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)
    else:
        next
```
In this code, the `next` command is used to skip the iteration if the `if` condition is not met, which is when `i % 2` is not equal to 0. If the condition is met, the code will print the value of `i` and move on to the next iteration.

Without the `next` command, the code would still technically work, but it would print a blank line when the condition is not met. By using the `next` command, the code is more efficient and concise.

Overall, the `next` command is a useful tool for controlling the flow of code in loops, enabling a programmer to effectively skip iterations that do not meet certain criteria.
