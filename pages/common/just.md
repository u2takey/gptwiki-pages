The command "just" is not a valid command on most operating systems. Hence, it would not perform any specific task or operation.

However, if you are referring to the Just task runner tool, it is a command-line tool used by developers to automate tasks related to build, testing, and deployment of software or applications. Developers can define and execute various commands or scripts using Just to automate their workflow. 

The basic syntax for using the "just" command is:

```
just [options] [target]
```

Here, the "options" refer to the various flags or arguments passed to the command. The "target" can be a specific task or command to be executed, such as building the project, running tests or deploying the app.

For example, to run a "test" task using Just, the command would be:

```
just test
```

This would execute the test command defined in the Justfile (a configuration file used by Just to define tasks) and display the results on the terminal.

Overall, the "just" command is a tool used for automating tasks, and its usage would vary based on the specific task or operation being performed.
