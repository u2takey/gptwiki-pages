As an AI language model, I am not capable of understanding the contextual meaning of "x_x" without additional information on where the command  or term was used. In different contexts, "x_x" can be interpreted as an emoticon expressing sadness, frustration, or defeat, or a variable or placeholder in computer programming languages.
