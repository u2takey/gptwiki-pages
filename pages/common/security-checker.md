The `security-checker` command is a tool for analyzing PHP dependencies for security vulnerabilities. It works by using the database of security advisories maintained by FriendsOfPHP. The command can be run in the following ways:

1. `security-checker:check`: This command is used to check a specific composer.lock file for vulnerabilities. The command will scan the dependencies in the lock file and check them against the security advisories database. The output will show a list of any vulnerabilities found.

2. `security-checker:security:check`: This command is used to perform a security check on all dependencies across all packages. This is helpful for users who want to quickly check all of their packages for potential vulnerabilities.

3. `security-checker:security:report`: This command generates a report of all known vulnerabilities in the installed packages. This report can be sent to other team members or used as a reference for future updates. 

Overall, the `security-checker` command helps to ensure that packages are updated regularly and helps to maintain the safety and security of PHP applications.

- Look for security issues in the project dependencies (based on the `composer.lock` file in the current directory):

`security-checker security:check`

- Use a specific `composer.lock` file:

`security-checker security:check {{path/to/composer.lock}}`

- Return results as a JSON object:

`security-checker security:check --format=json`
