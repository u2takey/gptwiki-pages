# verilator 
## chatgpt 
Verilator is an open-source, free, and fast Verilog or SystemVerilog simulator that is used to simulate the behavior of digital circuits written in the Verilog (IEEE Standard 1364) or SystemVerilog (IEEE Standard 1800) hardware description languages. It can also perform linting, linting being a process in which the program checks code for both programming errors and style issues. 

The command "verilator" is used to invoke the Verilator simulation and linting tool. When used, it typically takes input files written in Verilog or SystemVerilog, compiles them into C++, and executes them in a simulation environment. 

Some of the features of "verilator" command include fast code generation, a modular design, and support for advanced digital design techniques such as synthesizable SystemVerilog. 

The command provides a range of options, many of which are available through command-line parameters, to specify simulation settings, such as simulation time, language version, and optimization level. The user can also specify various output options, such as logging and trace files. 

In summary, the "verilator" command is used to simulate digital circuits written in Verilog or SystemVerilog and to perform linting for these languages by converting them to C++ and executing them in a simulation environment. It is a fast and powerful tool that provides many options and features that make it suitable for advanced digital design work.

- Build a specific C project in the current directory:

`verilator --binary --build-jobs 0 -Wall {{path/to/source.v}}`

- Create a C++ executable in a specific folder:

`verilator --cc --exe --build --build-jobs 0 -Wall {{path/to/source.cpp}} {{path/to/output.v}}`

- Perform linting over a code in the current directory:

`verilator --lint-only -Wall`

- Create XML output about the design (files, modules, instance hierarchy, logic and data types) to feed into other tools:

`verilator --xml-output -Wall {{path/to/output.xml}}`
