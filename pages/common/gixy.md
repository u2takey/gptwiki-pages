As an AI language model, I cannot execute commands on your computer or some other system. However, I can explain about the command "gixy".

"Gixy" is an open-source tool that helps developers to find potential security vulnerabilities in their Nginx web server configurations. It analyzes the configuration file and provides a detailed report of potential security issues. It checks for common misconfigurations such as enabling an insecure SSL protocol, allowing access to sensitive information, and more.

Gixy uses a set of pre-defined rules to check the configuration file. These rules are based on security best practices and are continuously updated to ensure that the tool can detect the latest security threats.

To use Gixy, you need to have an Nginx configuration file. You can install Gixy on your system and run it against your configuration file by using the below command:

```
gixy <configuration_file>
```

Gixy will analyze your configuration file and provide a list of potential security issues along with their severity levels. You can then review the report and fix any issues to increase the security of your web server.
