Git ls-remote is a command that allows you to view information about remote references (branches, tags, and notes) in a Git repository without having to clone the repository locally. 

When you run the command "git ls-remote", it displays a list of all available references (branches, tags, etc.) in the remote repository, along with their associated SHA-1 commit hashes. 

Some common use cases for git ls-remote include validating whether a specific commit or reference exists in a remote repository, checking the status of all remote branches and tags, and gathering information about a remote repository before cloning it locally. 

Here's an example of how to use git ls-remote command:

```
git ls-remote https://github.com/example/example.git
```

This command will show all the available references in the given remote repository along with their corresponding SHA-1 commit hashes.
