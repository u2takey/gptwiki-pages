# hg init

The command "hg init" is used to initialise a new Mercurial repository. This command creates a new ".hg" directory in the current working directory which is the main directory where all version control operations for the repository will be performed.

When this command is executed, it creates a new empty Mercurial repository in the current directory without any code or files tracked. The repository is now ready to start tracking files and changes to them.

Once the "hg init" command is executed, developers can start adding files and other contents to the repository using other Mercurial commands like "hg add" and "hg commit". This will allow developers to start tracking changes to their codebase and manage versions of their projects effectively.

Overall, the "hg init" command is a crucial step to set up a new Mercurial repository and start the process of version control for codebases.
