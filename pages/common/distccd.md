# distccd 
## chatgpt 
Distcc is a distributed compiler utility for C, C++, Objective C, Fortran, and other programming languages. It allows a user to distribute the compilation of their master project to multiple machines in a network, thus reducing the compile time on a single machine.

When the distccd command is executed on a machine, it starts the distcc daemon, which listens for incoming compilation requests from other machines in the network. The daemon provides a simple network interface to the compilers installed on the machine, allowing it to provide the compiler's services to other machines as if they were running the compiler locally.

The daemon can be configured to limit the amount of CPU and memory resources used by remote machines, and to restrict access to the daemon based on IP or hostname, ensuring that only trusted machines have access to the network resource.

The distcc command is primarily used for distributed compilation in development and build environments, where there is a need to compile large projects across multiple machines to achieve a faster compilation time.

- Start a daemon with the default settings:

`distccd --daemon`

- Start a daemon, accepting connections from IPv4 private network ranges:

`distccd --daemon --allow-private`

- Start a daemon, accepting connections from a specific network address or address range:

`distccd --daemon --allow {{ip_address|network_prefix}}`

- Start a daemon with a lowered priority that can run a maximum of 4 tasks at a time:

`distccd --daemon --jobs {{4}} --nice {{5}}`

- Start a daemon and register it via mDNS/DNS-SD (Zeroconf):

`distccd --daemon --zeroconf`
