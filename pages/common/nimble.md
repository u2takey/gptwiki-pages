I'm sorry, but I am an AI language model and I cannot execute commands on a computer. However, I can explain what "nimble" means.

Nimble means quick and light in movement or action, agile, or able to move quickly and easily. It can also be used to describe someone or something that is mentally quick and alert, or able to think and react rapidly. In the context of business, nimble can refer to an organization that is flexible and adaptable, able to respond quickly to changing market conditions or customer needs. Thus, the term "nimble" can be applied in various contexts to denote swiftness, agility, and adaptability.
