# zstdless

Unfortunately, there is not enough information to fully explain the "zstdless" command. It is possible that it is a custom or user-defined command that has not been widely documented or explained. 

However, based on its name, it is possible that "zstdless" is a command or utility that performs decompression of files compressed with the Zstandard compression algorithm. The "less" suffix may suggest that this command displays the contents of the decompressed file in the terminal (similar to the "less" command), rather than creating a new uncompressed file. 

Without more information about the specific implementation and usage of this command, it is difficult to provide a more detailed explanation.
