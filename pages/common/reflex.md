As an AI language model, I am not sure which context is being referred to for the command "reflex". However, in general, "reflex" can be a command or a tool that performs automated tasks when changes occur in a system. It is designed to monitor events, react to them automatically, and perform specified tasks in response. 

In computing, a reflex usually involves setting up a trigger that listens for certain events, such as changes in files, directory contents, or server responses. When a trigger event occurs, reflex triggers a pre-defined action, such as running a script, sending an email, or updating a database. Reflex is commonly used in DevOps scenarios, where it can be used to automate build and deployment processes, as well as in data analytics, where it can be used to analyze real-time data streams for anomalies or trends.

However, it is essential to understand that the specific command and its usage in the context of the system and software being used may vary. Therefore, it is necessary to refer to the manual or documentation of the specific tool to use the "reflex" command correctly.
