When you enter the command "webstorm" into a terminal or command prompt, the IDE application will be launched. This will open the WebStorm editor, and you can start writing code.

Once the application is launched, you can create a new project or open an existing one. You can also customize your workspace by changing the appearance, layout, and preferences.

WebStorm provides a range of features such as intelligent code completion, navigation, debugging, code analysis, and more. It also supports version control systems such as Git, SVN, and Mercurial.

Overall, WebStorm is a powerful tool for web development and helps developers write high-quality code efficiently with its many features and capabilities.
