The "dotnet ef" command is a tool used in .NET Core to manage the Entity Framework Core (EF Core). It is used for performing various database-related tasks such as creating migrations, updating database schemas, scaffolding code generation, and more.

Here's a brief explanation of the various commands available within the "dotnet ef" tool:

1. dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold: This command is used to scaffold a DbContext and its entities as per the database schema.

2. dotnet ef migrations add: This command creates an EF Core migration by comparing the current DbContext with the previous state of the DbContext stored in a previously created migration.

3. dotnet ef migrations remove: This command reverts the most recently applied migration.

4. dotnet ef migrations list: This command lists all the available migrations in a project.

5. dotnet ef database update: This command applies all pending migrations to the database.

6. dotnet ef database drop: This command deletes the database for a specified DbContext. 

7. dotnet ef dbcontext info: This command displays information about the DbContext, including the connection string, provider, and database.

Overall, "dotnet ef" is a powerful tool that enables developers to work efficiently with Entity Framework Core in .NET Core applications.

- Update the database to a specified migration:

`dotnet ef database update {{migration}}`

- Drop the database:

`dotnet ef database drop`

- List available `DbContext` types:

`dotnet ef dbcontext list`

- Generate code for a `DbContext` and entity types for a database:

`dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold {{connection_string}} {{provider}}`

- Add a new migration:

`dotnet ef migrations add {{name}}`

- Remove the last migration, rolling back the code changes that were done for the latest migration:

`dotnet ef migrations remove`

- List available migrations:

`dotnet ef migrations list`

- Generate a SQL script from migrations range:

`dotnet ef migrations script {{from_migration}} {{to_migration}}`
