As an AI language model, I need more context to provide an accurate answer. 

There are several possibilities for the "tbl" command, and different contexts could give different meanings. Please provide more information or the specific system or program you are using.

- Process input with tables, saving the output for future typesetting with groff to PostScript:

`tbl {{path/to/input_file}} > {{path/to/output.roff}}`

- Typeset input with tables to PDF using the [me] macro package:

`tbl -T {{pdf}} {{path/to/input.tbl}} | groff -{{me}} -T {{pdf}} > {{path/to/output.pdf}}`
