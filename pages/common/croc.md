"Croc" is a free and open-source command-line tool that allows users to securely and easily transfer files and folders between two computers or mobile devices.

To use croc, follow these steps:

1. Install croc on both the sending and receiving devices. This can be done by downloading the appropriate installation package from the official croc website (https://github.com/schollz/croc/releases) and following the installation instructions.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt on the sending device and navigate to the directory containing the files or folders that you want to transfer using the "cd" command.

3. Type the command "croc send [filename]" or "croc send [foldername]" and press enter. Replace [filename] with the name of the file you want to transfer, and [foldername] with the name of the folder you want to transfer.

4. Croc will generate a unique "code phrase" that you should remember or write down.

5. On the receiving device, open a terminal or command prompt and type the command "croc [code phrase]" and press enter. Replace [code phrase] with the unique code phrase generated by croc on the sending device.

6. Croc will begin transferring the file or folder securely and efficiently between the two devices. The transfer process can be monitored in real-time on both devices, and the transfer will automatically terminate once complete.

Overall, croc is a simple and effective way to transfer files between two computers or mobile devices securely, without the need for complicated setup or configuration.
