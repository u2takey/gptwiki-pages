`gdaladdo` is a command-line tool of the GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) package that allows you to create or modify overviews for raster datasets. An overview is a reduced resolution version of a raster image that can provide improved performance by allowing faster rendering of the image at certain zoom levels.

The basic syntax of the `gdaladdo` command is:

```
gdaladdo [OPTIONS] input_file [levels]
```

where:

- `OPTIONS` are various options that you can use to customize the behavior of the tool.
- `input_file` is the path to the input raster file.
- `levels` is a comma-separated list of the overview levels you want to generate. Each level corresponds to a certain reduction factor, where level 0 is the original resolution of the image and each subsequent level has twice the reduction factor of the previous level.

Some of the most commonly used options of the `gdaladdo` command are:

- `-r resampling_method`: specifies the resampling method to use when creating the overviews. The available methods are `nearest`, `average`, `gauss`, `cubic`, and `cubicspline`.
- `-ro`: indicates that the overviews should be built read-only, which means they will not be updated or regenerated automatically if the source data changes.
- `-clean`: deletes any existing overviews for the specified levels before generating new ones.
- `-minsize size`: specifies the minimum size (in pixels) of the smallest overview that will be created. This can be useful if you only want to generate overviews for larger zoom levels.

Here is an example of how to use the `gdaladdo` command:

```
gdaladdo -r average -ro -clean myimage.tif 2 4 8
```

This command generates read-only overviews for the `myimage.tif` raster file at levels 2, 4, and 8, using the `average` resampling method and deleting any existing overviews for those levels.

- Build overview images of a raster dataset using the "average" [r]esampling method:

`gdaladdo -r average {{path/to/input.tif}}`
