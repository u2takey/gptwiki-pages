1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
2. Type `psysh` in the terminal and hit enter to start the Psysh shell.
3. You will see the Psysh prompt `>>>` which indicates that you are now in the Psysh shell.
4. You can now type any valid PHP code, and the Psysh shell will execute it immediately and show you the result.
5. You can use the Psysh shell for various purposes such as testing PHP code, debugging errors, and exploring PHP libraries and functions.
6. Psysh also provides various features such as tab completion, history, and documentation lookup to help you work efficiently.

Overall, the `psysh` command is a useful tool for PHP developers to work with and explore PHP code dynamically in an interactive environment.
