Dolt is not a recognized or commonly used command in most operating systems or software. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a detailed explanation without any context or specific information about the program or system it relates to. If you could provide further details or context, I would be happy to help. 

## tldr 
 
> Dolt is an SQL database that you can fork, clone, branch, merge, push and pull just like a Git repository.
