Sorry, as an AI language model, I cannot execute commands like a computer. However, based on my research, there is a command-line tool called "nudoku" which is a console-based Sudoku game. It is designed to provide a simple and distraction-free interface with customizable key bindings and color themes. 

With nudoku, you can start a new game, load and save puzzles, navigate across the game board, input numbers, mark up candidate cells, undo and redo moves, and check the validity of the solution. 

You can also customize the difficulty level, enable or disable certain features, choose your preferred language, and even play with other players over the network. 

Overall, nudoku is a handy tool for Sudoku enthusiasts who want to sharpen their skills, kill time, or just have some fun solving puzzles from the comfort of their terminal.
