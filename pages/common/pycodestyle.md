# pycodestyle 
## chatgpt 
pycodestyle is a command line tool for checking the style of Python code. It was formerly known as pep8. 

When running the command "pycodestyle" in a terminal or command prompt, it scans Python files and checks them against the PEP 8 style guide for coding standards. It identifies spaces, indentation, line length, variable and function names, and other style issues. If any issues are found, it outputs them to the console with line numbers, so they can be corrected. 

The syntax of running the command is:
```
pycodestyle [options] [files or directories]
```
Options can include things like ignoring certain errors, setting the maximum line length, and specifying the indentation size.

Overall, running pycodestyle can help improve the readability and maintainability of Python code, making it easier for others to understand and work with.

- Check the style of a single file:

`pycodestyle {{file.py}}`

- Check the style of multiple files:

`pycodestyle {{file1.py}} {{file2.py}} {{file3.py}}`

- Show only the first occurrence of an error:

`pycodestyle --first {{file.py}}`

- Show the source code for each error:

`pycodestyle --show-source {{file.py}}`

- Show the specific PEP 8 text for each error:

`pycodestyle --show-pep8 {{file.py}}`
