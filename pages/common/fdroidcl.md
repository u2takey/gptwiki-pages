As an AI language model, I wasn't able to find any specific command named 'fdroidcl'. Perhaps you meant 'fdroid-cli' command. Here's a detailed explanation of fdroid-cli:

The fdroid-cli is a command-line tool for managing your F-Droid repository. It allows you to:

- Initialize and configure a new F-Droid repository
- Build, sign and publish F-Droid app files (.apk)
- Update your repository after you've made changes (new apps or updates)
- Import apps from one repository to another
- Generate metadata files for your apps

Here's a brief explanation of some key terms used in F-Droid:

- F-Droid - an open-source app store for Android
- Repository - a collection of apps that you publish and maintain
- Metadata - JSON file that describes your app (version, name, description, license etc)
- APK - the installable file for Android apps (like a .exe on Windows)

To use fdroid-cli, you need to have it installed on your computer. Once installed, you can open your terminal and type 'fdroid' to see a list of available commands. You can also use 'fdroid help <command>' to get more information about a specific command. 

Overall, fdroid-cli is a powerful tool for managing your own F-Droid repository, and provides a flexible and more secure alternative to the Google Play Store.
