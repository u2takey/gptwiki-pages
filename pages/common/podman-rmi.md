# podman rmi 
## chatgpt 
The `podman rmi` command is used to remove one or more images from the local image cache in Podman. The `rmi` stands for "remove image". 

Syntax:

```bash
podman rmi [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGE...]
```

- `OPTIONS`: Specifies any additional options to be used with the command.
- `IMAGE`: Specifies the name or ID of the image or images to be removed.

Options:

- `--all`, `-a`: Remove all images, including those that are not being used by any containers.
- `--force`, `-f`: Force removal of the image even if it is being used by a container.
- `--quiet`, `-q`: Suppress output, only display the IDs of the removed images.
- `--no-prune`: Do not remove the untagged parent images.

Example usage:

```bash
#Remove an individual image
podman rmi myimage:latest

#Remove multiple images
podman rmi myimage1:latest myimage2:latest

#Remove all images
podman rmi --all

#Remove an image that is being used by a container
podman rmi -f myimage:latest
``` 

It is important to note that removing an image will also remove all of its layers, including any cached or previously pulled layers. Once an image is deleted, it will need to be pulled again the next time it is needed.
