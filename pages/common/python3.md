# python3 
## chatgpt 
"python3" is a command used in command-line interfaces to run executable Python 3 programs or scripts. 

When you type "python3" in the terminal or command prompt, it launches the Python interpreter or shell, which provides a console-based environment for running Python code. 

This environment allows you to interactively execute Python statements and scripts, as well as access the Python standard library modules and third-party modules installed on your system.

Additionally, you can pass command-line arguments to the "python3" command to specify the input source file or the location of the Python executable, among other options. 

For example, the "python3 my_script.py" command will run the Python script "my_script.py" using the Python 3 interpreter, assuming that the script is located in the current working directory.
