In addition to browsing pages, the w3m command can also display images and tables, run JavaScript, and execute other web features typically used in graphical browsers. The command can also be customized through configuration files, command-line options and various plug-ins.

Overall, the w3m command is a powerful tool for accessing and browsing the web using only text-based interfaces. It provides users with a lightweight, fast and scalable way to explore web content even in low-resource environments, making it a popular choice in many Unix-like systems.
