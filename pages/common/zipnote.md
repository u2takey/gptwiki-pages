The `zipnote` command is a utility program used to view and modify comments that are associated with a zip archive. The `zipnote` command operates on an existing zip archive file and allows you to view or modify comments that are stored within the archive file.

Here is the detailed explanation of the command:

Usage: `zipnote [-w] zipfile`

Options:

- `-w`: This option specifies that the zip archive should be opened in write mode, which allows you to modify the comments. If this option is not specified, the zip archive will only be opened in read-only mode.

Arguments:

- `zipfile`: This argument specifies the path of the zip archive file that you want to view and/or modify the comments for.

Examples:

1. To view the comments for a zip archive file called `test.zip`, run the following command:

   `zipnote test.zip`

   This will display the comments stored in the `test.zip` file, if any.

2. To modify the comments for a zip archive file called `test.zip`, run the following command:

   `zipnote -w test.zip`

   This will open the `test.zip` file in write mode, allowing you to modify the comments stored in the file.

Once you have opened the zip archive file in write mode, you can modify the comments by typing in new text or deleting the existing comments. Once you are done modifying the comments, save the changes and exit the `zipnote` program. The changes will be saved back to the original zip archive file.
