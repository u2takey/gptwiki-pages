# pio device 
## chatgpt 
The command "pio device" is a command that is used in PlatformIO, which is an open-source ecosystem for IoT development. This command is used to display the list of connected targets, which includes serial ports, board IDs, and USB devices. 

When executed, the "pio device" command will obtain a list of all the devices that are currently connected to the system. This includes devices that use a serial connection, as well as devices that use a USB connection. Some examples of the devices that might appear in the list include microcontrollers, sensors, and other connected hardware.

The output of the command will provide information about each of the connected devices, such as the ID of the device, its description or name, the type of connection, and the serial number or vendor ID. This information can be useful when developing and debugging applications for IoT devices, as it allows the developer to identify the device and the type of connection that is being used.

Overall, the "pio device" command is a handy tool for developers working with IoT devices, as it allows them to quickly find and identify the connected devices that they are working with.
