Volta is not a command, but a tool for managing JavaScript projects. It is used to run and manage project-specific versions of Node.js and npm in a consistent and reliable way across different machines and operating systems. Volta manages the installation of Node.js and npm based on the project's configuration files, such as package.json, and ensures that the project has access to the necessary versions of these tools. It also allows developers to switch between different versions of Node.js and npm for different projects or parts of the same project. The usage of volta involves installing volta, setting it up for a project, and using its commands to manage the project's environment.
