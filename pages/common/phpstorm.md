2. Code Completion - PhpStorm can suggest and complete code for variables, classes, functions and methods, based on the context of the code.

3. Debugging - PhpStorm supports debugging of PHP code, which helps in identifying and fixing errors while running the code.

4. Integrated Version Control - PhpStorm supports integration with version control systems such as Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

5. Refactoring - PhpStorm allows the refactoring of code to improve its quality and maintainability.

The command "phpstorm" launches the PhpStorm IDE. To use this command, you need to have PhpStorm installed on your system. Once you run the command, the PhpStorm IDE will launch, and you can start working on your PHP project.
