# jhat

The jhat command is a tool provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK) that is used for diagnosing and troubleshooting memory-related issues in Java programs. Here is a detailed explanation of jhat command:

1. Syntax: 

The syntax of the jhat command is as follows:

jhat [ options ] <heap dump file>

2. Options: 

The jhat command can accept several options to customize its behavior. The most commonly used options are:

- -port <port_number>: The port number to use for the web server that hosts the heap dump analysis results. The default is 7000.
- -baseline <baseline_file>: Specifies the heap dump file to use as a baseline for comparison with the current heap dump. This option is useful for identifying memory leaks.
- -stackdepth <depth>: Specifies the maximum depth of stack traces to display in reports. Default is 4.

3. Heap Dump File: 

The jhat command requires a heap dump file to analyze. A heap dump file is a snapshot of the Java virtual machine's memory at a particular point in time. The heap dump file can be generated using the jmap tool provided by the JDK.

4. Working: 

Once the jhat command is executed, it loads the heap dump file into memory and starts a web server on the specified port. The heap dump is then analyzed and results are displayed on the web page hosted by the web server. The analysis includes information about the objects and their references, memory usage, and more.

The generated report provides several useful insights such as:

- List of instances for a particular class.
- Summary of memory usage by class.
- List of objects retaining a particular object of interest.
- Memory leaks and their sources. 

In summary, jhat is a command-line tool to analyze Java heap dumps, and it provides various analysis options on the heap dump data.

- Analyze a heap dump (from `jmap`), view via HTTP on port 7000:

`jhat {{dump_file.bin}}`

- Analyze a heap dump, specifying an alternate port for the http server:

`jhat -p {{port}} {{dump_file.bin}}`

- Analyze a dump letting `jhat` use up to 8 GB RAM (2-4x dump size recommended):

`jhat -J-mx8G {{dump_file.bin}}`
