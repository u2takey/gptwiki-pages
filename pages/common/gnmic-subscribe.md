# gnmic subscribe 
## chatgpt 
The gnmic subscribe command is used to receive streaming updates from a gNMI-compliant Network Device. Below is a detailed explanation of the command:

- "gnmic" refers to the gNMI client used to connect to and communicate with the Network Device. It is installed as part of the gNMI tools package.

- "subscribe" is the command that instructs gnmic to subscribe to updates from the Network Device.

When executed, the following happens:

1. The gnmic client establishes a connection with the Network Device.

2. The client sends a gNMI SubscribeRequest message to request updates from the Device. 

3. The subscription is maintained until the client explicitly unsubscribes or the connection is closed.

4. As updates are generated by the Network Device, they are returned to the client in the form of gNMI SubscribeResponse messages. The client can then process these messages as desired.

The gnmic subscribe command can be customized to specify additional options such as the specific paths and frequency of updates requested.

- Subscribe to target state updates under the subtree of a specific path:

`gnmic --address {{ip:port}} subscribe --path {{path}}`

- Subscribe to a target with a sample interval of 30s (default is 10s):

`gnmic -a {{ip:port}} subscribe --path {{path}} --sample-interval 30s`

- Subscribe to a target with sample interval and updates only on change:

`gnmic -a {{ip:port}} subscribe --path {{path}} --stream-mode on-change --heartbeat-interval 1m`

- Subscribe to a target for only one update:

`gnmic -a {{ip:port}} subscribe --path {{path}} --mode once`

- Subscribe to a target and specify response encoding (json_ietf):

`gnmic -a {{ip:port}} subscribe --path {{path}} --encoding json_ietf`
