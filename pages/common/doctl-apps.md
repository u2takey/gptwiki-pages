The command "doctl apps" is used in the DigitalOcean command-line interface (CLI) tool called "doctl" to interact with DigitalOcean's App Platform service. 

When used in the command-line, "doctl apps" displays a list of subcommands that can be used to manage, create, and deploy applications using the App Platform service. Some of these subcommands include:

1. "create" - This subcommand is used to create a new application on the App Platform using a specific configuration file. The configuration file contains details about the application's build and deployment settings, as well as links to the application's source code repository.

2. "list" - This subcommand gives a list of all your existing applications on the App Platform. It shows the name of each application, its ID, the region in which it was deployed, and its current status.

3. "deploy" - This subcommand is used to deploy changes made to an application using the App Platform service. It takes a configuration file that describes the changes and ensures that these changes are properly propagated across all instances of the application.

4. "logs" - This subcommand retrieves the logs for an application from its latest deployment.

Overall, "doctl apps" is a powerful command for developers who are using DigitalOcean's App Platform service to manage, deploy and monitor their applications.
