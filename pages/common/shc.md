# shc

The shc command is a utility tool used in Linux and Unix-based operating systems to compile and encrypt a shell script into a binary format. It stands for "Shell Script Compiler."

When you run the shc command, it first compiles the shell script into a C program, which is then processed by the C compiler to create a binary executable file. This executable is encrypted using a password and saved with an .x extension.

Here is an example usage of the shc command:

```
shc -f script.sh -o script.x
```

In this example, "script.sh" is the name of the shell script you want to compile, and "script.x" is the name of the encrypted binary executable file that you want to generate. The "-f" flag specifies the name of the input shell script file, and the "-o" flag specifies the name of the output encrypted binary file.

Once compiled and encrypted, the resulting binary file can be copied to other systems and executed without needing a shell interpreter. However, the password used to encrypt the file must be entered whenever the executable is run.

- Compile a shell script:

`shc -f {{script}}`

- Compile a shell script and specify an output binary file:

`shc -f {{script}} -o {{binary}}`

- Compile a shell script and set an expiration date for the executable:

`shc -f {{script}} -e {{dd/mm/yyyy}}`

- Compile a shell script and set a message to display upon expiration:

`shc -f {{script}} -e {{dd/mm/yyyy}} -m "{{Please contact your provider}}"`
