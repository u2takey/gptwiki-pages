As an AI language model, I do not have access to your specific context or permission to execute command line instructions on your behalf. However, I can explain the general functionality of the `az feedback` command in Azure CLI.

The `az feedback` command is used to provide feedback about Azure CLI to Microsoft. The command opens a feedback window in which users can submit feedback on the Azure CLI tool. The feedback is collected by Microsoft, reviewed and used to improve the Azure CLI tool.

The `az feedback` command does not require any arguments or parameters. Simply type `az feedback` and press enter to open the feedback submission window. Once the window is open, enter your feedback in the provided form and submit it to Microsoft.

It is important to note that the feedback submitted with `az feedback` is sent to Microsoft and may include personally identifiable information. Ensure that your feedback does not contain sensitive or confidential information before submitting it.
