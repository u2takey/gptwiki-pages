The `csvstat` command is a command-line tool that is used to generate statistical summaries of CSV files. The command analyzes the CSV file and calculates a variety of statistical values for each field in the file. These values can be used to gain insights into the data and to better understand its characteristics.

Some of the statistical values that `csvstat` generates include:

- Count: The number of non-null values in the field
- Unique: The number of unique values in the field
- Min: The minimum value in the field
- Max: The maximum value in the field
- Mean: The average value in the field
- Median: The median value in the field
- Stdev: The standard deviation of values in the field

The `csvstat` command can be used with a variety of options that allow you to customize the output. For example, you can specify the delimiter used in the CSV file, the encoding of the file, and the fields that should be included in the output.

To use the `csvstat` command, you simply need to specify the name of the CSV file as an argument. For example:

`csvstat mydata.csv`

This will generate a summary of the statistics for each field in the file. The output will be formatted in a table, with each row representing a different field and each column representing a different statistical value.
