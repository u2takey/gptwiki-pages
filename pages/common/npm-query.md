# npm query 
## chatgpt 
There is no npm command called "npm query". However, there is a command called "npm search", which is used to search the npm registry for packages that match a certain keyword. 

For example, if you want to search for packages that are related to "express", you can use the following command: 

```
npm search express
```

This will return a list of packages with the term "express" in their name, description, or keywords. 

You can also use search modifiers to narrow down your search results. 

For example, if you only want to search for packages that are scoped to "@company", you can use the following command:

```
npm search "@company/*"
```

This will return a list of packages that are scoped to "@company". 

Overall, the "npm search" command is useful for finding packages that are relevant to your project and can help you save time by not having to create your own solutions from scratch.
