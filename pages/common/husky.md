As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific context in which you are asking about "husky". However, "husky" is a general term that can refer to a few different things based on the context:

1. Husky is a breed of dog, known for its thick coat and working abilities.
2. "Husky" can be used to describe a type of voice or speech that is deep and rough.
3. Husky is also the name of a package in the Node.js ecosystem, which provides Git hooks for a developer to use in their project's repository. The command "husky" on the command line is often used to configure these hooks and manage the configuration of the package. It can be used to run pre-commit or pre-push checks, for example, to ensure that code meets certain quality standards before it is committed or pushed to the repository. The package is commonly used to enforce specific coding standards or best practices. 

Without additional context, it is difficult to provide more specific information about the command "husky".
