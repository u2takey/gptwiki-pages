# hg commit 
## chatgpt 
The command "hg commit" is a command in the Mercurial version control system. It is used to commit changes made to the repository, which means saving the changes permanently with a message explaining what was changed. 

When you run the "hg commit" command, you will be prompted to enter a commit message in a text editor. This message should explain what changes you made to the repository. Once you save and close the message, the commit will be saved with a unique revision number and a timestamp.

It is important to note that committing changes in Mercurial is a local operation, meaning that the changes are only saved to your local repository. If you want to share your changes with others, you will need to push your commits to a shared repository.

The "hg commit" command can also take additional parameters such as specifying specific files or directories to commit, and allowing you to amend a previous commit. 

Overall, the "hg commit" command is an essential part of using Mercurial to manage code changes, as it allows you to keep track of and save changes made to your code.
