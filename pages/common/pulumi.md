# pulumi 
## chatgpt 
Pulumi is a command-line tool that is used for managing cloud infrastructure. It is a platform that allows users to write code in their preferred language (such as Python, TypeScript, or Go) to create and manage infrastructure as code. The command "pulumi" refers to the command-line interface for interacting with the Pulumi platform.

The pulumi command offers a broad range of functionality, which includes deploying and updating infrastructure, setting up continuous delivery pipelines, and creating/running automated tests. Some of the main features of the pulumi command include:

1. Creating and deploying infrastructure as code: Using the pulumi command, users can define their infrastructure using code and deploy it to a cloud provider. This allows for repeatable and consistent infrastructure deployments.

2. Managing infrastructure resources: Pulumi offers a way for developers to manage cloud resources, such as virtual machines, load balancers, and databases through code. This makes it easier to manage cloud infrastructure consistently and securely.

3. Integrating with Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines: Pulumi can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines to ensure that infrastructure changes are tested, reviewed, and deployed in a controlled and auditable way.

4. Collaborating with team members: Pulumi offers features that enable collaboration among team members who are working on the same infrastructure. This includes the ability to share infrastructure code, track changes, and perform code reviews.

Overall, the pulumi command is a powerful tool that enables developers to manage their cloud infrastructure quickly and efficiently. It makes the process of creating, deploying, and managing infrastructure seamless and straightforward, allowing for more time to be spent on developing critical applications.

- Create a new project using a template:

`pulumi new`

- Create a new stack using an isolated deployment target:

`pulumi stack init`

- Configure variables (e.g. keys, regions, etc.) interactively:

`pulumi config`

- Preview and deploy changes to a program and/or infrastructure:

`pulumi up`

- Preview deployment changes without performing them (dry-run):

`pulumi preview`

- Destroy a program and its infrastructure:

`pulumi destroy`
