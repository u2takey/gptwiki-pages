waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan is a command-line tool used for upscaling and denoising images. This tool uses the neural network to reduce noise and increase image resolution. The command waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan is used to specify the name of the tool and to specify input and output files. 

Here is a detailed explanation of each term:

- waifu2x: refers to the name of the tool. It is named after the anime and manga term "waifu" which means a character that a fan has a strong emotional attachment to.
- ncnn: refers to the neural network computing framework used by waifu2x. It stands for "Nihao's convolutional neural network".
- vulkan: refers to the tool's use of the Vulkan graphics API, which is used to accelerate the processing of images with GPUs.

The command is used to specify input and output files. For example, if the command is:

waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan -i input_file.jpg -o output_file.jpg

This means that the input file is "input_file.jpg" and the output file is "output_file.jpg". The tool will apply the neural network to upscale and denoise the image, and then save the result to the output file.

In summary, waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan is a tool that uses a neural network and the Vulkan graphics API to upscale and denoise images. The command is used to specify input and output files.

- Upscale an image:

`waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan -i {{path/to/input_file}} -o {{path/to/output_file}}`

- Upscale an image by a custom scale factor and denoise it:

`waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan -i {{path/to/input_file}} -o {{path/to/output_file}} -s {{1|2|4|8|16|32}} -n {{-1|0|1|2|3}}`

- Save the upscaled image in a specific format:

`waifu2x-ncnn-vulkan -i {{path/to/input_file}} -o {{path/to/output_file}} -f {{jpg|png|webp}}`
