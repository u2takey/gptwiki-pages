# bmaptool 
## chatgpt 
Bmaptool is a command-line tool used in Linux-based systems for creating and manipulating block maps. Block maps are a type of mapping structure used for storing data on block devices such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives, and flash memory cards. 

The bmaptool command provides a set of tools for creating, inspecting, and manipulating block maps. It allows users to create compressed block maps for a given image file or block device, and to write these block maps to another block device or even a network share. Users can use bmaptool to verify the integrity of an image file by comparing the original file to the image created with a bmap file.

The bmaptool command syntax involves several subcommands, including:

1. bmaptool create: This subcommand is used to create a block map for a given image file or block device. The block map includes information such as block size, block positions, and the hash values of the blocks. The resulting bmap file can be used to write the original image to another block device with greater speed and less wasted space.

2. bmaptool write: This subcommand writes an image file to a block device using the information in the bmap file. This allows you to write a pre-built image to another device or network location quickly and efficiently.

3. bmaptool report: This subcommand generates a report on the block map created by the tool. It includes information such as block size, total number of blocks, and the hash values of each block. 

Overall, bmaptool is a powerful command-line tool used for creating, manipulating and verifying block maps, making it an essential tool for system administrators and developers working with block devices.

- Create a blockmap from image file:

`bmaptool create -o {{blockmap.bmap}} {{source.img}}`

- Copy an image file into sdb:

`bmaptool copy --bmap {{blockmap.bmap}} {{source.img}} {{/dev/sdb}}`

- Copy a compressed image file into sdb:

`bmaptool copy --bmap {{blockmap.bmap}} {{source.img.gz}} {{/dev/sdb}}`

- Copy an image file into sdb without using a blockmap:

`bmaptool copy --nobmap {{source.img}} {{/dev/sdb}}`
