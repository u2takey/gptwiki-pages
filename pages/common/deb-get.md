I'm sorry, but "deb-get" is not a valid command in Linux. It may be possible that the command has been misspelled or that it is a custom command created by a user or developer. 

Assuming that you meant "apt-get," which is a popular package manager for Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu, I can explain it in detail.

"apt-get" is used to manage software packages on Debian and Ubuntu systems. With "apt-get," you can install, upgrade, and remove packages through the command line. The command uses a repository system to download and install software packages onto your computer.

The basic syntax of "apt-get" command is:

sudo apt-get [command] [package_name]

Here, the "sudo" command is used to run the "apt-get" command with root privileges, which is necessary for installing, upgrading, or removing packages.

Some common commands that can be used with "apt-get" are:

- "update": This command updates the local package lists from the repositories.

- "upgrade": This command upgrades all the installed packages on the system.

- "install": This command installs a package onto the system.

- "remove": This command removes a package from the system.

- "autoremove": This command removes any unused dependencies and packages from the system.

Overall, "apt-get" is a powerful package manager that makes it easy to manage software on Debian-based systems.
