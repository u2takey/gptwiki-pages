The "sponge" command is a tool in Linux/Unix that is used for manipulating the content of a file or files. It is mainly used for writing to a file to save changes made during a pipeline. More specifically, sponge command reads data from standard input, saves it to a file, and then prints that same data to the standard output again.

The syntax of the sponge command is as follows:

```
sponge [OPTION] [FILE]
```

Here,

- "[OPTION]" can be any of the options supported by the command.
- "[FILE]" is the name of the file that you want to perform operations on. If no filename is provided, the command will read from the standard input.

Some of the commonly used options of the sponge command are:

- -h, --help: It displays the help message and exits.
- --version: It displays the version information and exits.
- -a, --append: Append data to the file instead of overwriting.
- -I, --ignore-interrupts: Ignore interrupt signals.
- -V, --verbose: Display verbose output about the operations performed.

To use the sponge command, you can pipe the input to the command and specify the filename as shown below:

```
echo "Hello World" | sponge file.txt
```

This will write the content "Hello World" to the file.txt. 

Overall, the sponge command is a useful utility tool that simplifies the process of writing to a file and makes it more convenient to work with pipelines.
