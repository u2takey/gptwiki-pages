The `gh codespace` command is a command-line interface (CLI) tool provided by GitHub that allows the user to create and manage cloud-based development environments, called Codespaces.

When the `gh codespace` command is executed in the terminal, it opens a wizard-like interface that prompts the user to provide inputs such as:

- Name of the codespace
- Selecting the GitHub repository that you want to develop in the codespace
- Choosing a virtual environment based on the programming language used in your repository
- Selecting a billing plan (when using a paid plan)

Once you've provided these details, GitHub spins up a virtual machine (VM) that's pre-configured with all the tools and libraries required for the coding environment. This allows the user to easily access their code and development environment from anywhere and collaborate with teammates in real-time. 

In addition to creating a new codespace, `gh codespace` command also allows developers to manage existing codespaces, such as starting, stopping, and deleting them from the command line.
