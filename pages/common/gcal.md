I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have access to your specific environment to know what command line tool you're referring to. "gcal" is a shortened term that could refer to different things depending on the context.

For instance, "gcal" could refer to a Linux command line utility for displaying a calendar. Or it could also refer to the Google Calendar API's command line tool.

So, please provide more context or details about what "gcal" you're referring to, so that I can provide a more accurate and helpful explanation.
