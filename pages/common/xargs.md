# xargs 
## chatgpt 
The `xargs` command is used to convert standard input (stdin) into arguments for a command. It reads items from standard input, separated by white space, and passes them as arguments to the specified command. 

The syntax for using `xargs` is as follows:

```bash
command | xargs [options] [command]
```

Here, `command` is the input source for `xargs`. It could be any command that generates output on stdout, like `ls`, `find`, or even another `xargs` command. The options modify the behavior of `xargs`, and `[command]` is the command that will receive the arguments from `xargs`.

Some common options for `xargs` are:

- `-n`: limits the number of arguments passed to each command invocation.
- `-d`: specifies the delimiter used to separate input items (default is whitespace).
- `-I`: replaces a placeholder string with the current item from the input source.

For example, to find all .txt files in the current directory and delete them using `rm`, you can use:

```bash
find . -name "*.txt" | xargs rm
```

Here, `find` generates a list of .txt files, which is then passed to `xargs`. `xargs` then invokes `rm` for each file in the list, deleting them.

Note that `xargs` can be a powerful tool, but it should be used with caution. The commands it invokes can have unintended consequences if not used correctly.

- Run a command using the input data as arguments:

`{{arguments_source}} | xargs {{command}}`

- Run multiple chained commands on the input data:

`{{arguments_source}} | xargs sh -c "{{command1}} && {{command2}} | {{command3}}"`

- Delete all files with a `.backup` extension (`-print0` uses a null character to split file names, and `-0` uses it as delimiter):

`find . -name {{'*.backup'}} -print0 | xargs -0 rm -v`

- Execute the command once for each input line, replacing any occurrences of the placeholder (here marked as `_`) with the input line:

`{{arguments_source}} | xargs -I _ {{command}} _ {{optional_extra_arguments}}`

- Parallel runs of up to `max-procs` processes at a time; the default is 1. If `max-procs` is 0, xargs will run as many processes as possible at a time:

`{{arguments_source}} | xargs -P {{max-procs}} {{command}}`
