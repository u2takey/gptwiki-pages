# git touch 
## chatgpt 
I'm sorry, but the "git touch" command does not exist. 

However, "touch" is a command used in the Unix and Linux operating systems to create a new file with a specified name or update the timestamp of an existing file. The command "git touch" would simply use the "touch" command within the context of a Git repository to update the timestamp of a file or create a new file.

It's worth noting that updating the timestamp of a file will not trigger a commit in Git. To make changes to a Git repository, you'll need to use commands like "git add" to stage changes and "git commit" to commit them to the repository's history.

- Create new files and add them to the index:

`git touch {{path/to/file1 path/to/file2 ...}}`
