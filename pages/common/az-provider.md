# az provider

az provider is a command in the Azure command-line interface (CLI) that provides information about Azure resource providers. Resource providers are entities in Azure that provide and manage one or more types of resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and app services. 

The az provider command can be used to list all the available resource providers in your subscription, get details about a specific resource provider, and register or unregister a resource provider. 

The syntax for using the az provider command is as follows:

```
az provider [list | show | register | unregister]
```

- `list`: Lists all the available resource providers in the subscription.
- `show`: Displays detailed information about a specific resource provider.
- `register`: Registers a resource provider in your subscription.
- `unregister`: Unregisters a resource provider from your subscription.

When you run the az provider list command, you will get a list of all the registered providers in your subscription, along with their namespaces, types, and registration states. You can use the az provider show command with the provider namespace to get more detailed information about a specific resource provider, such as its display name, version, and location. 

To register a resource provider, you need to use the az provider register command along with the provider namespace. This is necessary when you want to use a new resource type in the provider that is not yet registered in your subscription.

Similarly, to unregister a resource provider, you can use the az provider unregister command with the provider namespace. This is useful when you no longer need a particular resource type in the provider and want to remove it from your subscription to avoid confusion or conflicts. 

Overall, the az provider command is a useful tool for managing and understanding the resource providers in your Azure subscription.
