As an AI language model, I am assuming that the command mentioned here is "mscore." 

mscore is a command-line tool for the music notation software MuseScore. It is used for several purposes, such as generating a MIDI file from a MuseScore document, converting MuseScore files to MusicXML format, and performing batch operations on multiple MuseScore files.

When you run the mscore command in a terminal, MuseScore launches with a blank score ready for you to begin composing. Once you have finished creating your score, you can export it to a variety of formats such as PDF, MIDI, MusicXML or MP3.

In order to use mscore, you first need to have MuseScore installed. Once it is installed, you can open the terminal and type "mscore" followed by the name of a MuseScore file or the location of the file on your computer. 

The mscore command can be very useful for musicians who want to automate certain tasks or perform operations on multiple MuseScore files at once. However, it is important to note that using mscore requires you to have a basic understanding of the command line and the MuseScore software itself.
