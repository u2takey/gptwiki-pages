The `gofmt` command is a tool for formatting Go source code. It is a tool that is used to ensure consistent formatting of Go code, making it easier to read and understand. The `gofmt` command can be used to format a single file, a package or a complete project.

The `gofmt` command works by analyzing the Go source code and reformatting it in a specified standardized manner. This standard is outlined in the official Go coding style guide, which prescribes a set of rules for formatting code that include things like indentation, line width, and placement of braces and parentheses.

To use `gofmt`, simply run the command followed by the name of the file, package or directory to be formatted. By default, the `gofmt` tool writes any changes to the source file, overwriting the original contents. However, you can pipe the output of `gofmt` to a new file or use the `-w` flag to write the formatted output back to the original file.

In summary, `gofmt` is a useful tool for ensuring consistent formatting and style of Go source code, which in turn leads to more readable and maintainable code.
