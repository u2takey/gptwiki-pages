As an AI language model, I cannot be sure which specific software you are referring to as "subl." However, the most common interpretation of "subl" is referring to the command-line interface for Sublime Text. Therefore, here's an explanation for "subl" as the command-line interface for Sublime Text:

The "subl" command is used to open files or directories in Sublime Text from the command line interface. It is a shortcut for launching Sublime Text with the specified file or directory as an argument, allowing users to quickly and easily edit files without having to navigate through their file system to find them.

Here is its basic syntax:

`subl <filename>`

This command will open the specified file in Sublime Text.

Some other useful options that can be used with the "subl" command are:

- `-n`: opens a new instance of Sublime Text
- `-a`: opens the file in an existing instance of Sublime Text, if one is already running
- `-w`: waits for Sublime Text to close before continuing

For example, the command `subl -a myfile.txt` opens the `myfile.txt` file in an existing instance of Sublime Text, while `subl -n mydirectory` will open a new instance of Sublime Text with the `mydirectory` directory as its working directory.

In summary, the "subl" command is a convenient way to quickly open files in Sublime Text from the command line interface, making editing and navigating files easier and more efficient.
