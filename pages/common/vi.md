The vi command is a text editor used in Unix-based operating systems.

When you enter the command "vi" in the command line, it opens up a blank document in the vi editor. You can then start typing text into this document or open an existing document for editing. 

There are several modes in the vi editor: 

1. Normal mode: This is the default mode when you first open a document. In this mode, you can navigate through the document, delete text, copy and paste text and perform other commands. 

2. Insert mode: In this mode, you can type in new text or edit existing text. You enter insert mode by typing "i" in normal mode. 

3. Visual mode: In this mode, you can select lines or blocks of text for manipulation. You enter visual mode by typing "v" in normal mode. 

4. Command mode: In this mode, you can execute commands such as searching for text, replacing text, saving the document or quitting the editor. You enter command mode by typing ":" in normal mode.

Some common commands in vi editor include:

1. :w - saves the document you are working on

2. :q - quits vi editor

3. :q! - quits and discard changes

4. :wq - saves and quits the editor

5. / - search for a specific word or phrase in the document

6. :s/old/new - replace the first instance of old with new

7. :s/old/new/g - globally replace old with new
