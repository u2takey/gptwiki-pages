# dolt checkout 
## chatgpt 
The `dolt checkout` command is used in the Dolt data versioning system to switch the working branch of the repository to a specified branch or commit.

The syntax for the command is as follows:

```
dolt checkout <branch or commit>
```

Where `<branch or commit>` can be the name of the branch, or a specific commitâ€™s hash.

If `<branch or commit>` is given, Dolt will switch the working branch to that branch or commit. If the specified branch or commit is not currently in the repository, Dolt will attempt to fetch it from the remote repository.

If no argument is given, Dolt will switch the working branch to the default branch of the repository.

Note that if there are any uncommitted changes in the working directory, Dolt may not be able to switch branches until those changes are committed or discarded. In such cases, Dolt may prompt the user to commit or discard the changes before proceeding.
