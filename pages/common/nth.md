## chatgpt 
The "nth" command is a function that is used to retrieve the element at a specified position in a list or sequence in programming languages such as Python. The position is defined by an index value which starts at 0 for the first element in the list.

The syntax for the "nth" command may vary depending on the programming language used, but typically it takes the following form:

nth(list, n)

Where "list" is the sequence of elements from which the desired element will be retrieved, and "n" is the index of the desired element.

For example, in Python, the "nth" command can be used as follows:

my_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
third_element = nth(my_list, 2)
print(third_element)

In this example, the "nth" command is used to retrieve the third element from the list (index 2), which is "cherry". The output of the program, therefore, will be "cherry".

- Name a hash:

`nth -t {{5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99}}`

- Name hashes in a file:

`nth -f {{path/to/hashes}}`

- Output in json format:

`nth -t {{5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99}} -g`

- Decode hash in Base64 before naming it:

`nth -t {{NWY0ZGNjM2I1YWE3NjVkNjFkODMyN2RlYjg4MmNmOTkK}} -b64`
