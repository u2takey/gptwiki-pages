`npm-why` is not a valid command on its own. However, `npm why <pkg> <args>` is a valid command in the npm package manager.

The `npm why` command is used to display information about why a specific package is installed. It shows a tree of all the packages that depend on the specified package and why they depend on it. This can be useful for debugging dependency issues or understanding why a particular package is required.

`<pkg>` is the package name for which you want to find out the why information. `<args>` are any additional arguments that you want to pass to the command.

For example, to find why `react` package is installed in your project, you can run:

```
npm why react
````

This will display a tree of all the packages that depend on `react` and why they depend on it. It will also show which version of `react` is being used and if it is a direct or indirect dependency. You can use additional arguments like `--verbose` to get more detailed information.
