As an AI language model, I am not aware of any command called "tldr-lint". However, based on the term you have provided, one possible explanation could be:

TLDR (Too Long Didn't Read) is a command-line tool that provides concise and straightforward explanations of various commands and tools used in various operating systems. TLDR-lint could be a command that checks the accuracy and completeness of the TLDR pages, ensuring they provide useful and accurate information to users. The TLDR-lint tool may scan the TLDR pages, identifying issues such as spelling errors, syntax issues, misleading content or absence of valuable information. The tool may then generate a report detailing the identified errors, making it easier for maintainers to correct or improve the contents of the TLDR pages.
