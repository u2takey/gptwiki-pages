The "groups" command is a Linux/Unix command used to display the group memberships for a particular user. 

When executed without any options or arguments, it lists the groups that the user is a part of. 

Example: 

If you run "groups" command as a standard user "johndoe", it will display a list of all the groups that "johndoe" is a member of, like this:

```
$ groups 
johndoe adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare
```

- "johndoe" is the username. 
- "adm", "cdrom", "sudo", "dip", "plugdev", "lpadmin", and "sambashare" are the groups that the user is a member of. 

If you want to check the group memberships for a specific user, you can specify the username as an argument, like this:

```
$ groups alice
alice : alice sudo developers
```

This will display the groups that the user "alice" is a part of.

Overall, the "groups" command is a useful tool for checking the group memberships of a user on a Linux/Unix system.
