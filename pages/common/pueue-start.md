The command "pueue start" is typically used in a Linux environment to start a queued task or job that was previously added to the Pueue queue. Pueue is a command-line tool that helps in the management of background processes, and it allows for the scheduling of commands to run one after the other or simultaneously.

The "pueue start" command signals to Pueue to start running the job that has been queued. This command will initiate the execution of the next command in the queue, and once a command is started, it will run in the background.

When executed, the "pueue start" command will bring up a list of queued tasks, and you will need to choose which task you would like to start. Once selected, the command will print out any output to the console, and the task will continue running in the background until it completes successfully or is killed.

Overall, the "pueue start" command is helpful for managing tasks and jobs in the background, allowing for efficient and organized task execution.
