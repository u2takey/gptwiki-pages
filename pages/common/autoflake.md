Autoflake is a command-line utility tool for removing unused imports and variables in Python code. It helps in optimizing Python code and making it more efficient.

The autoflake command takes one or more Python script files as inputs and analyzes each line of code to determine which imports and variables are unused. It then removes the unused code and rewrites the file, resulting in a more optimized version of the original code.

Autoflake command includes several options that let you specify different configurations to remove unused code from a Python script file. Some of the most commonly used options are:

- `--remove-unused-variables` which removes unused variables
- `--remove-unused-arguments` which removes unused arguments in function definitions
- `--recursive` which applies autoflake to all .py files in subdirectories recursively

Here's an example:

`autoflake myfile.py --remove-unused-variables`

This command runs the autoflake utility on the 'myfile.py' Python script file and removes all unused variables from it. The modified file will be saved in place.

Overall, the autoflake command helps in reducing the clutter and improving the readability of Python code by removing the extraneous code.

- Remove unused variables from a single file and display the diff:

`autoflake --remove-unused-variables {{file.py}}`

- Remove unused imports from multiple files and display the diffs:

`autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports {{file1.py}} {{file2.py}} {{file3.py}}`

- Remove unused variables from a file, overwriting the file:

`autoflake --remove-unused-variables --in-place {{file.py}}`

- Remove unused variables recursively from all files in a directory, overwriting each file:

`autoflake --remove-unused-variables --in-place --recursive {{path/to/directory}}`
