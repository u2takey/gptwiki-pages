# git gh-pages

The command "git gh-pages" is used to create or switch to the Github Pages branch in the local repository. 

Github Pages is a feature of Github that allows users to publish web pages directly from their Github repository. By default, Github Pages uses the master branch for publishing websites. However, users can also create a separate branch for Github Pages called gh-pages to host their website.

The "git gh-pages" command is part of the Git command-line tool and it does the following:

1. If the gh-pages branch does not exist, it creates a new branch and switches to it. 
2. If the gh-pages branch already exists, it simply switches to it. 

Once you are on the gh-pages branch, any changes you make to your website files will be reflected on your Github Pages website. You can also use the Git command-line tool to commit and push your changes to the remote repository on Github. 

Overall, the "git gh-pages" command simplifies the process of creating and managing a separate Github Pages branch in your local repository.
