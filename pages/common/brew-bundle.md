The "brew bundle" command is used in Homebrew, a popular package manager for macOS, to execute a "brewfile".

A brewfile is a text file that lists all the Homebrew packages and dependencies required for a project or workstation. A brewfile can be created manually or automatically by using a tool like "brew bundle dump".

When the "brew bundle" command is executed, Homebrew reads the brewfile and installs or updates any packages listed in the file that are not already installed. This command ensures that all packages and dependencies required by a project or workstation are available and up to date.

Overall, the "brew bundle" command is a useful tool for managing Homebrew packages and ensuring that all required dependencies are installed for a project or workstation.
