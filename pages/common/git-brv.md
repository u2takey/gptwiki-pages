# git brv 
## chatgpt 
I'm sorry, but there is no standard command in Git called "git brv". It is possible that it is a custom command, alias or a typo.

However, the most likely command that you might refer to is "git branch -v". This command lists all the branches in your local repository and their corresponding commit messages and hash values. It also shows the current active branch with an asterisk.

The output of the "git branch -v" command may look like this:

```
* main             64120cc This is the latest commit message
  feature-branch   1234abc Another commit message
  development      9876def A different commit message
```

In this example, the current active branch is "main". The branch "feature-branch" and "development" have some commits with hash values "1234abc" and "9876def" respectively.

I hope this helps. If you have any further questions or clarifications, feel free to ask.
