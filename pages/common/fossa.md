As an AI language model, I cannot use "execute" commands. However, I can provide you with details about the term "fossa". 

The fossa is a carnivorous mammal native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Eupleridae, which is endemic to the island. They are agile predators that mainly feed on lemurs and other small animals. Fossa has a slender body with short, powerful legs and retractable claws that are well-suited for climbing trees. They have short, reddish-brown fur and a long, bushy tail. Fossas are solitary animals that are active during the day and night. The species is classified as vulnerable due to deforestation and hunting.
