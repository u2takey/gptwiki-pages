Multipass is a command-line utility that allows users to manage and launch virtual machines (VMs) on their local machine. The command provides a simple and efficient way to create and manage VMs in a multi-cloud environment.

Here are some of the most common uses of the multipass command:

1. Creating a VM: The `multipass launch` command is used to create a new VM. Users can specify the number of CPUs, amount of RAM, and disk image size during the creation process.

2. Starting and stopping a VM: The `multipass start` and `multipass stop` commands are used to respectively start and stop a VM.

3. Viewing VM details: The `multipass info` command is used to view detailed information about a running VM, including its IP address and disk space usage.

4. Connecting to a VM: The `multipass shell` command is used to connect to a running VMâ€™s terminal.

5. Managing VM snapshots: The `multipass snapshot` command is used to create, list, and delete snapshots of a VM. Snapshots are useful for saving the state of a VM at a particular point in time.

Overall, the multipass command simplifies the process of managing VMs and enables developers to quickly and easily launch and test different environments.
