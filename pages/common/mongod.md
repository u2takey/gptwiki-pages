`mongod` is a command-line utility used to start and run the MongoDB daemon. It is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB database which listens for incoming client requests and manages database operations.

When `mongod` is executed, it starts the MongoDB server on the default port 27017, and also listens on the local host by default. `mongod` can be executed with a variety of configuration options that can alter the behavior of the server, such as setting the database directory location or changing the port number.

The typical usage of `mongod` is to start the server in the foreground of a terminal window using the following command:

```
mongod
```

This will start the MongoDB server process and display logs on the console window. If the command is successful, the server will be up and running and ready to accept client connections.

Overall, `mongod` is a crucial command for starting and running the MongoDB database server, and it is important to understand its functionality and configuration options for efficient database management.
