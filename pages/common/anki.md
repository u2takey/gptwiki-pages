Anki is a software program used for creating, studying, and memorizing flashcards. The command "anki" simply launches the Anki program on your computer, allowing you to begin using the application. Once launched, you can create your own flashcards, download pre-made decks from the internet, and study your cards using various tools and techniques built into the program. Anki is especially useful for language learners, medical students, and anyone else who needs to memorize a large amount of information.
