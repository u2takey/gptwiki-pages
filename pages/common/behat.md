Behat is a command-line tool used for Behavior-driven development (BDD) testing of web applications. It allows testers and developers to write automated acceptance tests in a natural language that is understandable to non-technical stakeholders. 

When you run the command "behat" in the terminal, it will execute the features and scenarios in the file named "feature" located in the project directory. The command will parse the feature file and create a test report. 

Behat uses Gherkin syntax to define the behavior of the application in natural language. The Gherkin syntax consists of keywords, such as "Given", "When", "Then", and "And", followed by description texts that form the actual test steps.

The features and scenarios written in Behat can be used to automate acceptance tests in web application development, ensuring that the developed software fulfills the requirements specified by the stakeholders. The tests can also be used to ensure that code changes do not break the application functionality.

In summary, running the Behat command executes the tests written in Gherkin syntax and generates a report, allowing developers and stakeholders to ensure the application meets the required criteria before deployment.
