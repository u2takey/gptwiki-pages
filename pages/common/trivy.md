Trivy is an open-source vulnerability scanner tool that scans container images and helps to detect vulnerabilities, securely and easily.

The trivy command in detail -

1. Installation - To use trivy, it needs to be installed on the system. The installation can be done through package managers like homebrew or apt. The installation command for apt would be:

```
apt-get install trivy
```

2. Scanning images - Trivy is used for scanning container images. To scan an image, we need to provide the name of the image as an argument to the trivy command. The syntax for scanning an image is:

```
trivy [image-name]
```

For example, the following command will scan the ubuntu image:

```
trivy ubuntu
```

3. Output Format - The default output format for trivy is a human-readable format. However, the tool provides various output formats to choose from. To specify an output format, we can use the --format flag. For example, to output the results in JSON format, we can use the command:

```
trivy --format json [image-name]
```

4. Severity - Trivy also provides severity levels to the vulnerabilities detected in the scanned container image. The levels are high, medium and low. To filter the output based on severity, use the --severity flag followed by the severity level. For example, to filter vulnerabilities with high severity, use the command:

```
trivy --severity HIGH [image-name]
```

5. Ignore Unfixed Vulnerabilities - By default, trivy reports all vulnerabilities, including unfixed ones. If we want to ignore unfixed vulnerabilities, we can use the --ignore-unfixed flag. The command to ignore unfixed vulnerabilities is:

```
trivy --ignore-unfixed [image-name]
```

6. Ignore Specific Vulnerabilities - If we want to ignore specific vulnerabilities, we can use the --ignore flag followed by the CVE ID of the vulnerability. The command to ignore specific vulnerabilities is:

```
trivy --ignore CVE-2018-14618 [image-name]
```

Trivy is a powerful vulnerability tool that can help detect and fix potential security issues in container images. By following the commands mentioned above, one can use trivy effectively.

- Scan an image:

`trivy image {{image:tag}}`

- Scan the filesystem for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations:

`trivy fs --security-checks {{vuln,config}} {{path/to/project_directory}}`

- Scan a directory for misconfigurations:

`trivy config {{path/to/iac_directory}}`

- Generate output with a SARIF template:

`trivy image --format {{template}} --template {{"@sarif.tpl"}} -o {{path/to/report.sarif}} {{image:tag}}`
