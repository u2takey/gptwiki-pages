Mutagen is a Python library for handling audio metadata. It provides a simple way to read and write metadata for various audio formats like MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A, and more. It is primarily used for accessing metadata information like the artist, album, year, genre, track number, and other attributes related to an audio file.

Some of the key features of Mutagen library are:

- Supports various metadata formats like ID3v1, ID3v2, VorbisComment, and APEv2
- Provides a consistent API for accessing metadata across different file formats
- Supports editing of metadata for multiple files in batch mode
- Ability to read and write album art or cover image

The use of Mutagen library requires installation, which can be done using pip command in Python. It can be installed by running the following command in the terminal:

```pip install mutagen```

Once installed, you can use the library in your Python scripts to read or write metadata for an audio file. Some example code to read metadata for an MP3 file is shown below:

```python
from mutagen.mp3 import MP3

mp3_file = MP3("path_to_file.mp3")
print("Title:", mp3_file.get("TIT2"))
print("Artist:", mp3_file.get("TPE1"))
print("Album:", mp3_file.get("TALB"))
print("Year:", mp3_file.get("TDRC"))
```

This code reads the metadata for a given MP3 file and prints out the title, artist, album, and year. Similar code can be written for other audio file formats supported by Mutagen library.

In summary, Mutagen is a powerful library for handling audio metadata in Python, providing a consistent API for accessing and editing metadata across different file formats.
