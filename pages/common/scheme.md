The command "scheme" is used to start a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment for Scheme programming language. REPL is an interactive programming shell that allows developers to write, test and evaluate code expressions in real-time. 

When you type "scheme" in your terminal, it initiates a Scheme REPL, where you can start writing Scheme code. You can use this environment to experiment with different programming concepts, test functions, and debug code issues. 

Scheme is a minimalistic and powerful Lisp-based programming language that provides a simple syntax and powerful features like closures, high-order functions, and macros. It is widely used in academia and industry for teaching programming, algorithm design, and developing production-level applications. 

In conclusion, the "scheme" command is the starting point to enter the Scheme REPL and begin coding in one of the most popular and powerful functional programming languages.

- Start a REPL (interactive shell):

`scheme`

- Run a scheme program (with no REPL output):

`scheme --quiet < {{script.scm}}`

- Load a scheme program into the REPL:

`scheme --load {{script.scm}}`

- Load scheme expressions into the REPL:

`scheme --eval "{{(define foo 'x)}}"`

- Open the REPL in quiet mode:

`scheme --quiet`
