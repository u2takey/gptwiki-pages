The command "hg log" is a version control system command that is used with the Mercurial tool. It is used to display a chronological history of the changesets in the repository. 

The "hg log" command gives a detailed output, and it shows the changes that have been made to the repository, such as the author, date, commit message, file paths, and revision number of each changeset. The command also shows the list of files that have been added, modified or deleted in each changeset.

The "hg log" command can also be used with various options to get different outputs. Some of the commonly used options include specifying a range of revisions to be displayed, sorting the output by author or date, displaying only specific file paths or only revisions that affect a specified file, and displaying the changesets in a graph or tree format.

Overall, using the "hg log" command helps a user to track the changes made to the repository, understand the history of the files, and identify any errors or issues related to the changesets.
