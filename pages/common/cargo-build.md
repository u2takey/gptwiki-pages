# cargo build 
## chatgpt 
The "cargo build" command is used in Rust programming language and is used to compile the source code into an executable binary file. 

When executed, this command triggers the Rust build process which includes several stages such as:

1. Checking dependencies: Cargo checks if all the required dependencies are installed in the system before starting compilation.

2. Downloading dependencies: If some dependencies are not installed, Cargo downloads and installs them from the crates.io repository.

3. Compiling the source code: After checking and downloading dependencies, Cargo compiles the Rust source code.

4. Linking: During the compilation process, Cargo links all the compiled code and dependencies into an executable binary file. 

The compiled program is stored in the "target" directory under the project directory. The output binary file can be executed using the "./target/debug/program_name" command.

The cargo build command also generates a lock file named "Cargo.lock" which contains information about the dependency versions used in the project. This allows for reproducible builds, where the same versions of dependencies are used every time the project is built. 

Overall, the "cargo build" command is a crucial component in the Rust development process, as it provides an easy, automated way to compile and build Rust programs.

> Compile a local package and all of its dependencies.
> More information: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html>.

- Build the package or packages defined by the `Cargo.toml` manifest file in the local path:

`cargo build`

- Build artifacts in release mode, with optimizations:

`cargo build --release`

- Require that `Cargo.lock` is up to date:

`cargo build --locked`

- Build all packages in the workspace:

`cargo build --workspace`

- Build a specific package:

`cargo build --package {{package}}`

- Build only the specified binary:

`cargo build --bin {{name}}`

- Build only the specified test target:

`cargo build --test {{testname}}`
