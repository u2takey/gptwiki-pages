`git extras` is not a native Git command. It is a collection of useful Git utilities and scripts created by Tj Holowaychuk, which add extra functionality to the Git command line interface.

Once installed, `git extras` provides a number of additional commands, including:

- `git-setup`: a tool that automates the initial Git configuration process
- `git-summary`: provides a summary of the repository, including the number of lines and files changed
- `git create-branch`: creates a new branch and switches to it
- `git delete-branch`: deletes a branch
- `git release`: tags the current commit with a version number and pushes the tag to the remote repository
- `git ignore`: creates a .gitignore file for the repository
- `git author`: sets the author information for the repository

To use a `git extras` command, type `git` followed by the command name. For example, to use `git-summary`, type:

```
git summary
```

Overall, using `git extras` can make working with Git easier and more efficient, by providing additional functionality that may not be available in the default Git commands.
