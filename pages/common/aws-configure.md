# aws configure 
## chatgpt 
The command 'aws configure' is used to set up the AWS (Amazon Web Services) CLI (Command Line Interface) on your local machine. It prompts the user to enter the Access Key ID and the Secret Access Key, which they can obtain from the AWS Management Console. 

The Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are used by the CLI to authenticate requests that are made to AWS services. Once the user enters these keys and configures their region, the AWS CLI is ready to use. 

The 'aws configure' command sets up the configuration file for the AWS CLI. This file is located at ~/.aws/config and stores the user's AWS access key and secret access key, default region name, and output format. 

In summary, the 'aws configure' command is used to set up the AWS CLI on a local machine and create the configuration file that stores the user's AWS access key and secret access key.
