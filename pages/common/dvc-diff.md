The `dvc diff` command is a Data Version Control (DVC) command used to show the differences between two DVC tracked files or directories. It compares the contents of the files and shows the differences between them. 

The `dvc diff` command can be used with the following optional arguments:

- `--all` option: used to show all the changes between the two DVC tracked files or directories.

- `--target` option: used to specify the target branch or tag for comparison.

The `dvc diff` command works by comparing the DVC tracked files or directories with their previous versions. It is useful to identify changes made to the data or code over time, and helps to keep a track of the versions of the files. 

When running the `dvc diff` command, the output would generally show the differences between the two versions of the tracked file or directory. The differences could be in terms of the size, content, or structure. The output could also display the exact changes made in the files, and helps to identify the changes between two versions of the data. 

Overall, the `dvc diff` command is a great tool for data scientists to keep a track of the changes made to their data over time, and to identify the changes that were made and why.
