# keychain 
## chatgpt 
keychain is a command-line tool that manages SSH keys and other authentication credentials for secure access to servers or systems. It enables SSH clients to store their private keys and other authentication credentials in an encrypted format, protected by a passphrase. Once the passphrase is provided, keychain can retrieve the required credentials and unlock them for SSH or other operations.

keychain simplifies the SSH authentication process by eliminating the need to enter passphrases repetitively, especially when accessing multiple servers or systems. It also reduces the risk of losing or exposing private keys by storing them securely.

The keychain command can create, delete, update and list SSH keys and other credentials, as well as manage the associated passphrases. It supports various types of keys, including RSA, DSA, and ECDSA. In addition, it can integrate with other automation tools and scripting languages, such as Bash, Python, and Perl.

To use keychain, first, you need to install it on your system. Then, you can create and configure keys, add them to the keychain, and specify the locations of the key files. Once the keys are added to the keychain, you can SSH to remote hosts without entering the passphrase each time. You can also configure keychain to automatically load SSH keys on login or use them only for specified hosts or networks.

Overall, keychain simplifies the management of SSH keys and other authentication credentials, making it easier and more secure to access remote systems.

- Check for a running ssh-agent, and start one if needed:

`keychain`

- Also check for gpg-agent:

`keychain --agents "{{gpg,ssh}}"`

- List signatures of all active keys:

`keychain --list`

- List fingerprints of all active keys:

`keychain --list-fp`

- Add a timeout for identities added to the agent, in minutes:

`keychain --timeout {{minutes}}`
