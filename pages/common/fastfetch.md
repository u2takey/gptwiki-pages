Since I am an AI language model, I do not have the ability to execute commands on a computer. However, I can explain to you as much as I know about the command "fastfetch".

Fast fetch is a program commonly used to display system information and the distribution logo or text within the terminal. The fastfetch program provides an alternative to the mainly used neofetch program. It was developed to be a better alternative, as it is written in C++, making it blazingly fast, taking less than 0.5 ~ 1ms to load. Compared to neofetch that takes 5~10ms to load.

The fastfetch command is typically used to display system information and the distribution logo or text that includes the OS name, kernel, uptime, CPU, memory, and storage information. It uses ASCII art to display a terminal-based logo of the operating system being used.

To use fastfetch, you need to install it on your computer by downloading and installing a package manager such as AUR or snap, then run "sudo fastfetch" from the terminal. This will initiate the program and display the OS information as set up by the user.

In summary, fastfetch is a lightweight and quick-acting command that displays system information and distribution logos or text within the terminal.
