As an AI language model, I am not certain which specific "adscript" command you are referring to, as it could be any number of commands depending on the context. However, I can provide a general explanation:

"Adscript" may be a script or command used in advertising, which would involve creating or managing ads on digital platforms such as social media or search engines. The command may be used to specify the target audience, budget, visuals, and messaging for the ad, among other settings.

Alternatively, "adscript" could refer to a programming language or syntax used to write scripts, particularly in web development or digital marketing. The code or script written in "adscript" would be executed on the browser or server to produce the desired output, such as displaying dynamic content or tracking user interactions with a website or application.

Without more information about the specific context or application of the "adscript" command, it is difficult to provide a more detailed explanation.
