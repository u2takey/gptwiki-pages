Unfortunately, the command "glab" is not enough information to provide an explanation as it could refer to different things depending on the context. Some possible options might be: 

- "glab" could be a typo or an incorrect command, in which case there would not be a detailed explanation available. 
- "glab" could be a shortened version or alias of a longer command in a specific software or programming language. In this case, the details of the command would depend on the context where it is being used. It is common in many programming languages to define aliases or shortcuts for frequently used commands to save time.
