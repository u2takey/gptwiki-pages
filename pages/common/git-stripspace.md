The `git stripspace` command is used to remove all leading and trailing white spaces from lines in files tracked by Git. When you commit files to Git, it is important to maintain a consistent and clean code style. However, sometimes white spaces can inadvertently create inconsistencies and distractions in code.

The `git stripspace` command removes these inconsistencies by stripping out all leading and trailing white spaces from lines of code. This command can be especially helpful when working with large codebases where code maintenance can be a challenge.

Here is an example of how to use the `git stripspace` command:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal on your computer.

2. Navigate to the Git repository directory you want to work on.

3. Run the `git stripspace` command by typing it into the command prompt or terminal:

```
git stripspace
```

4. Press Enter to execute the command.

Git will automatically remove all leading and trailing white spaces from lines in files tracked by Git in the current repository.

This command is a handy tool for keeping your code clean and organized, especially when working with code that involves multiple contributors or teams. By keeping your code well-organized, debugging and maintenance become much easier in the long run.
