The command "hakyll-init" is a command-line utility used by Haskell developers and content creators to generate a basic Hakyll site structure. "Hakyll" refers to a static site generator written in Haskell, which allows users to create and maintain static websites using simple templates and metadata files. 

The "hakyll-init" command creates a new Hakyll site directory with some basic files and folders configured according to Hakyll's default structure. This includes a "content" folder containing Markdown or other markup files, a "templates" folder containing site-wide templates written in Hakyll's template language, a "static" folder containing static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images, a "config.yaml" file for site configuration and deployment settings, and a "site.hs" file which is the main entry point for the Hakyll generator. 

Using "hakyll-init" command, users can quickly set up a new Hakyll site and start creating content without having to manually create and configure each directory and file. It is a time-saving and convenient tool for developing Hakyll based static websites.
