# git mergetool 
## chatgpt 
The `git mergetool` command is used to launch a merge resolution tool for resolving conflicts that occur during the merging of Git branches. 

When there are conflicts between branches, Git will highlight them in the code with conflict markers. A merge resolution tool can help to simplify and automate the process of resolving these conflicts.

The `git mergetool` command will launch the tool specified in the git configuration file for merging. By default, Git uses the `vimdiff` tool, but you can configure Git to use other difftools like meld, kdiff3, etc.

Once launched, the merge resolution tool will display the files with conflicts and allow the user to select which version of the code to keep for each conflict. Once conflicts are resolved, save the file and close the merge resolution tool.

After the merge conflicts are resolved and saved, the user would need to run the `git add` and `git commit` commands to save the changes to the repository. 

In summary, `git mergetool` is a handy command-line utility that launches a merge resolution tool to help resolve conflicts that occur during the merging of Git branches.
