`pwgen` is a command-line utility used to generate random passwords. 

The syntax of the command is: 

`pwgen [OPTIONS] [LENGTH] [COUNT]`

Options:
- `-s`: Include special characters in the generated password.
- `-y`: Do not include special characters in the generated password.
- `-s-y`: Include only secure passwords containing letters, digits, and special characters, but no whitespace.
- `-0`: Do not include digits (0-9) in the generated password.
- `-1`: Include only one character of each type (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters) in the generated password.
- `-c`: Instructs pwgen to generate a cryptographically secure password.
- `-B`: Does not include ambiguous characters such as lowercase "L", uppercase "I", and the number "1", and the letter "O" and the number "0".

Length: sets the length of the generated password.

Count: sets the number of passwords to generate.

For example, to generate one random password with a length of 8 characters, the command would be:

`pwgen 8 1`

This would output a random password, such as "rV7Kj2yD". 

A more secure password can be generated by adding the `-s-cB` options:

`pwgen -s -c -B 12 1`

This would output one cryptographically secure, 12-character password containing uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, without ambiguous characters, such as "j^&P)s4Cn8xd". 

Note that generated passwords should always be treated as sensitive information and carefully managed to prevent unauthorized access.
