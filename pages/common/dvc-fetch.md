dvc fetch is a command used in Data Version Control (DVC) that allows users to download data files from a remote storage location to their local machine. 

When you run the command "dvc fetch", it automatically fetches the latest commits from the remote storage and downloads the updated data files to your local machine. This command helps users to keep their local copies of data up-to-date with the latest changes made to the data files in the remote storage. 

The "dvc fetch" command is especially useful when working with large data files that are stored in remote storage locations. Instead of downloading the entire data files every time there is a change, you can use this command to fetch only the changes made to the data files since the last time you downloaded them. 

In summary, the "dvc fetch" command is used to download the latest changes made to data files in a remote storage location to your local machine. It helps keep your local copies of data files up-to-date with the latest changes to the data files.
