Mkdocs is a command-line tool used to create, build, and serve static websites based on Markdown files. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. The mkdocs command comes with several subcommands that perform different functions:

1. mkdocs new [project-name]: This command creates a new project directory with the basic structure needed to get started with mkdocs.

2. mkdocs serve: This command starts a local web server to serve your website. It allows you to preview your website in your browser before you publish it.

3. mkdocs build: This command builds your website by converting your Markdown files into HTML files that are ready to be published.

4. mkdocs gh-deploy: This command is used to deploy your website to Github. It automates the process of uploading your HTML files and other necessary files to a Github repository and makes your website publicly available.

5. mkdocs --version: This command provides information about the version of Mkdocs that is installed on your system.

Overall, the mkdocs command is a powerful tool for creating static websites quickly and easily. It is particularly useful for technical documentation and other content-heavy websites, where Markdown can help simplify the editing and formatting process.
