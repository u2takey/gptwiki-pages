I am sorry, but as a language model AI, I have no access to your system's internal configuration, files, or commands for security and privacy purposes. However, I can provide you general information about the "gitsome" command.

Gitsome is an open-source Git command-line tool developed in Python. It provides a more interactive way to use the Git command-line utility. Gitsome allows users to perform Git operations, such as cloning, pushing, pulling, committing, branching, and merging, and provides additional features, like autocomplete, interactive help, and syntax highlighting.

To use Gitsome, you need to install it first by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install gitsome
```

Once installed, you can start using Gitsome by typing 'gitsome' followed by the Git command you want to use. For example, to clone a Git repository using Gitsome, you can run the following command:

```bash
gitsome clone <repository-url>
```

This will clone the repository to your local machine using the Git command and display the progress and output in an interactive interface provided by Gitsome.

Overall, Gitsome is an excellent tool for developers who prefer using the Git command-line interface but want a more interactive and user-friendly experience.
