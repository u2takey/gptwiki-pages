## chatgpt 
Locust is an open-source load testing tool used to simulate user traffic on a website, app or API. 

When the command "locust" is executed, the Locust engine is started and a web interface is launched. The web interface is used to configure and control the load-testing process. 

Once the interface is launched, the user can customize and configure the load testing settings. This includes choosing the number of simulated users, the time frame for the test, and the URL of the website or API that will be tested. 

Once the test is configured, the user can start the load-testing process by clicking the "start swarming" button in the web interface. This will start the simulated user traffic on the website or API, and generate data and statistics for the test. 

The user can then monitor the test in real-time via the web interface, viewing data on response times, errors and other performance metrics. The data generated by the test can be downloaded and analyzed to optimize website or API performance. 

Overall, the "locust" command is used to start the Locust engine and launch the web interface used to configure and monitor the load testing process.

- Load-test "example.com" with web interface using locustfile.py:

`locust --host={{http://example.com}}`

- Use a different test file:

`locust --locustfile={{test_file.py}} --host={{http://example.com}}`

- Run test without web interface, spawning 1 user a second until there are 100 users:

`locust --no-web --clients={{100}} --hatch-rate={{1}} --host={{http://example.com}}`

- Start locust in master mode:

`locust --master --host={{http://example.com}}`

- Connect locust slave to master:

`locust --slave --host={{http://example.com}}`

- Connect locust slave to master on a different machine:

`locust --slave --master-host={{master_hostname}} --host={{http://example.com}}`
