# pypy 
## chatgpt 
Pypy is a Python Interpreter that is written in Python and complies code on runtime. It is a fast alternative to the traditional Python interpreter. When you run the command 'pypy' in a terminal window (assuming you have installed Pypy), it starts the Pypy interpreter session, where you can execute Python code interactively or run Python script files.

The advantage of using Pypy instead of the traditional Python interpreter is the speedup in the execution of Python code. Pypy uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation to optimize and speed up the execution of Python programs. It also has better memory management, which helps in reducing memory usage and providing better performance.

In summary, the command 'pypy' launches the Pypy interpreter, which is a faster and more efficient implementation of the Python programming language. You can use it to run Python scripts or execute Python code interactively.

- Start a REPL (interactive shell):

`pypy`

- Execute script in a given Python file:

`pypy {{path/to/file.py}}`

- Execute script as part of an interactive shell:

`pypy -i {{path/to/file.py}}`

- Execute a Python expression:

`pypy -c "{{expression}}"`

- Run library module as a script (terminates option list):

`pypy -m {{module}} {{arguments}}`

- Install a package using pip:

`pypy -m pip install {{package_name}}`

- Interactively debug a Python script:

`pypy -m pdb {{path/to/file.py}}`
