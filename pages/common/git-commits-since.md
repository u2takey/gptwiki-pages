# git commits-since 
## chatgpt 
The command "git commits-since" is used to display the list of commits that have been made since a particular date or a particular commit.

The syntax for using this command is:

git log --pretty=oneline <commit>...<end-commit>

Here, replace "<commit>" and "<end-commit>" with the commit IDs or names of the commit from which you want to start seeing commits and the end commit until which you want to see the commits.

For example, the following command will show all commits that have been made since January 1st, 2021:

git log --pretty=oneline --since=2021-01-01

Similarly, if you want to see all commits made between two specific commits, you can use:

git log --pretty=oneline <commit-id>...<end-commit-id>

This will show you a list of all the commits made between the two specified commits.

Overall, the "git commits-since" command is useful for viewing a list of commits made during a particular time range or between two specific commits, which can be helpful in keeping track of code changes and project updates.
