# unexpand

The unexpand command is a Unix command that is used to convert tabs to spaces in a file or standard input. It is the opposite of the expand command, which converts spaces to tabs.

The syntax of the unexpand command is as follows:

```
unexpand [OPTIONS] [FILE]
```

Here, OPTIONS refers to any additional flags or options that can be used with the command, and FILE refers to the name of the file that needs to be converted. If no FILE is specified, the standard input is used.

Some of the commonly used options with the unexpand command are:

- `-a` : Convert all spaces to tabs, even those that occur in the middle of a line.
- `--tabs=N` : Set the tab width to N spaces (default is 8).
- `-t` : Instead of converting all spaces to tabs, only convert spaces that occur at the beginning of a line.

When the unexpand command is executed, it reads the input file and replaces each tab character with the appropriate number of spaces (according to the tab width). This can help to improve readability and consistency of files that use tabs instead of spaces for indentation.

Overall, the unexpand command is a useful tool for manipulating text files in Unix-based systems.

- Convert blanks in each file to tabs, writing to standard output:

`unexpand {{path/to/file}}`

- Convert blanks to tabs, reading from standard output:

`unexpand`

- Convert all blanks, instead of just initial blanks:

`unexpand -a {{path/to/file}}`

- Convert only leading sequences of blanks (overrides -a):

`unexpand --first-only {{path/to/file}}`

- Have tabs a certain number of characters apart, not 8 (enables -a):

`unexpand -t {{number}} {{path/to/file}}`
