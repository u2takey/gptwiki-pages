The `ver` command is used in the Windows command prompt to display the version of the operating system currently installed on the computer. 

When you run the `ver` command, it displays a message similar to the following:

```
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.836]
```

This message contains several pieces of information:

- "`Microsoft Windows`" indicates the name of the operating system.
- "`Version`" specifies the version number of the operating system.
- "`10.0.18362.836`" is the actual version number, which is made up of several components:
  - "`10`" indicates the major version number of Windows (Windows 10, in this case).
  - "`0`" is a reserved component and is always 0.
  - "`18362`" is the build number, which identifies the specific release of Windows 10.
  - "`836`" is the build revision, which indicates a specific cumulative update to the build.

Overall, the `ver` command is a simple way to quickly determine which version of Windows you're running, which can be useful for troubleshooting or troubleshooting compatibility issues with software or hardware.
