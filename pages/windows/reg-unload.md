# reg unload 
## chatgpt 
The "reg unload" command is used in the Windows operating system to unload a registry hive that has been loaded into the registry. 

When a registry hive is loaded, it is stored in a portion of memory called the "registry space". This allows programs and processes to access and modify the entries in the registry hive. However, if a registry hive is no longer needed, it can be unloaded from the registry space using the "reg unload" command. 

Here's how to use the command:

1. Open the Command Prompt window with administrative privileges.
2. Type "reg unload" followed by the path and file name of the registry hive that you want to unload.
3. Press Enter.

For example, to unload the "MyHive" registry hive that is stored in the "C:\RegHives" folder, the command would be:

reg unload HKLM\MyHive

Once the command is executed, the registry hive will be removed from the registry space and will no longer be accessible to programs and processes.
