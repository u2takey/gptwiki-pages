The command rdpsign is used to sign Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) files with a digital signature. This signature helps to verify the authenticity of the RDP file, which is particularly important when transmitting sensitive data over a network. The digital signature ensures that the RDP file has not been tampered with or modified since it was signed.

The rdpsign command requires several parameters to be entered in order to function properly. These parameters include the file path of the RDP file to be signed, the digital certificate to be used for the signature, the hash algorithm to be used, and the signing timestamp. The command also allows for the inclusion of additional command line options, such as specifying whether the signature should be embedded in the RDP file or stored separately.

Examples of rdpsign commands include:

rdpsign /sha256 rdpfile.rdp /t http://timestampserver.com /tr http://issuer.com

This command would sign the RDP file "rdpfile.rdp" using the SHA256 hash algorithm, with a timestamp obtained from the specified timestamp server and digital certificate obtained from the specified issuer.

rdpsign /sha1 rdpfile.rdp /tr http://timestampserver.com /certstore my /thumbprint ”abcde12345”

This command would sign the RDP file "rdpfile.rdp" with the SHA1 hash algorithm, using a digital certificate with the specified thumbprint stored in the "my" certificate store. The signing timestamp would be obtained from the specified timestamp server. 

In summary, the rdpsign command is used to sign RDP files with a digital signature for the purpose of verifying authenticity and preventing modification.

- Sign an RDP file:

`rdpsign {{path\to\file.rdp}}`

- Sign an RDP file using a specific sha256 hash:

`rdpsign {{path\to\file.rdp}} /sha265 {{hash}}`

- Enable quiet output:

`rdpsign {{path\to\file.rdp}} /q`

- Display verbose warnings, messages and statuses:

`rdpsign {{path\to\file.rdp}} /v`

- Test the signing by displaying the output to `stdout` without updating the file:

`rdpsign {{path\to\file.rdp}} /l`
