The command "choco search" is a command-line interface (CLI) command that is used in the Chocolatey package manager. 

This command is used to search for a package in the Chocolatey package repository. When you run this command, it will return a list of packages that match the search term with a brief description, version information, and the number of downloads.

Here is how to use the "choco search" command:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt window on your computer.

For example, if you want to search for the package "firefox", you would type the following command:

choco search firefox

3. Press the Enter key to execute the command.

4. The CLI will then query the Chocolatey repository for any packages that match the search term and display the results in the terminal window.

5. You can then select a package from the search results to install using the "choco install" command.
