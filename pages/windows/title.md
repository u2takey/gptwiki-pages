The "title" command is used to change the title of the command prompt window. 

Syntax: title [string] 

The "string" parameter is the new window title that you want to set.

For example, if you want to change the title of the command prompt window to "My Command Prompt", you can use the following command: 

title My Command Prompt

After executing this command, the title of the Command Prompt window will be changed to "My Command Prompt".

This command is particularly useful when working with multiple command prompt windows, as it allows you to easily distinguish between them. Additionally, if you are working on a project or task and want to keep track of it, you can use the "title" command to set a descriptive title for the window, making it easier to identify.
