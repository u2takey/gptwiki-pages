The `msg` command is a command that provides a way to send a message to another user on the same network. 

It has the following syntax: 

`msg {username | sessionname | sessionid | @filename | *} [/SERVER:servername] [/TIME:seconds] [/V] [/W] [message]`

- `username` is the username of the user you want to send a message to. 
- `sessionname` is the name of the session that the user is currently logged into. 
- `sessionid` is the ID of the session that the user is currently logged into. 
- `@filename` specifies that the message should be taken from a file. 
- `*` sends the message to all the sessions on the specified server. 

You can use the `/SERVER` option to specify the name of the server the message will be sent to. 

The `/TIME` option specifies the number of seconds to wait for a response before timing out. 

The `/V` option causes the command to be verbose so that it prints the message to the command prompt. 

The `/W` option causes the message to appear as a pop-up window on the user's screen, and it requires the user to acknowledge the message before proceeding. 

Finally, the [message] parameter specifies the actual message to be sent to the user. 

Overall, the `msg` command can be a useful tool for communicating with other users on the same network quickly and easily.
