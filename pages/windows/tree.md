The `tree` command is a utility in Unix-based operating systems that displays the contents of a directory in a tree-like format. 

When executed, the `tree` command lists the files and directories in the current directory (by default) and all of its subdirectories, recursively, displaying them in a hierarchical format, with subdirectories and their contents being indented. It can be used to visualize the structure of directories and subdirectories on a system.

The `tree` command can be used with various options to modify the output, such as specifying the maximum depth of subdirectories, excluding certain files or directories, sorting the output by various criteria, displaying file sizes or permissions, and more.

Some common usages of `tree` command are:

- Displaying a tree of the current directory: `tree`
- Specifying a path for the directory to display: `tree /path/to/directory`
- Excluding hidden files: `tree -a`
- Including file sizes and permissions: `tree -h`
- Displaying the tree with a maximum depth of 3 subdirectories: `tree -L 3`
- Sorting the output by filename: `tree -f`
- Creating a static HTML page of the directory tree: `tree --dirsfirst -H . -o tree.html`
