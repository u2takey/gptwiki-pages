The `for` loop is a control structure in many programming languages, including shell scripting, Python, and others. It enables the execution of a set of commands repeatedly, based on a specified condition or range.

Syntax:

for variable in sequence
do
    commands
done

`variable` is a user-defined name for a variable that will hold the value of each item in the `sequence`. The `sequence` can be a list of items, a range, or a command that generates a list of items.

The `commands` executed for each item in the `sequence` can be a single command or a series of commands enclosed in a block.

Typical usage of `for` is iterating over items in a list, file, or directory. Here is an example of using the `for` loop to iterate over all files in the current directory in a bash shell:

```
for file in *
do
    echo $file
done
```

This will print the name of each file in the current directory line by line.

- Execute given commands for the specified set:

`for %{{variable}} in ({{item_a item_b item_c}}) do ({{echo Loop is executed}})`

- Iterate over a given range of numbers:

`for /l %{{variable}} in ({{from}}, {{step}}, {{to}}) do ({{echo Loop is executed}})`

- Iterate over a given list of files:

`for %{{variable}} in ({{path\to\file1.ext path\to\file2.ext ...}}) do ({{echo Loop is executed}})`

- Iterate over a given list of directories:

`for /d %{{variable}} in ({{path\to\directory1.ext path\to\directory2.ext ...}}) do ({{echo Loop is executed}})`

- Perform a given command in every directory:

`for /d %{{variable}} in (*) do (if exist %{{variable}} {{echo Loop is executed}})`
