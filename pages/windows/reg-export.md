The 'reg export' command is a Windows Command Prompt command that is used to export a copy of a Windows Registry key or subkey to a file. Here is a detailed explanation of the command and its parameters:

Syntax: reg export [keyname] [filename] [/y]

Parameters:
- keyname: Specifies the full path of the key to be exported. This can be an absolute path or a relative path starting from one of the predefined root keys (e.g. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, etc.). Enclose the keyname in quotes if it contains spaces or special characters.
- filename: Specifies the name and location of the exported file. This can be an absolute or relative file path. If a relative file path is used, it is relative to the current directory. If the file already exists, the command prompts for confirmation before overwriting it. Enclose the filename in quotes if it contains spaces or special characters.
- /y: Specifies that the command should overwrite the file without prompting for confirmation.

Functionality: The 'reg export' command creates a Registry hive file that contains all the values and subkeys of the specified Registry key or subkey, including the key's name, type, data, and security information. This file can be later imported into another Registry using the 'reg import' command, or viewed and edited with a Registry editor like regedit.

Example:
To export the 'Desktop' subkey of the current user's Registry hive to a file named 'mybackup.reg' in the current directory, run the following command:

reg export "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Desktop" mybackup.reg

This will create a file called 'mybackup.reg' in the current directory that contains the 'Desktop' subkey and all of its values and subkeys. To import this file back into the Registry, use the 'reg import' command:

reg import mybackup.reg

Note: Be careful when exporting and importing Registry keys, as making any changes to the Registry can have serious consequences on the stability and performance of the operating system. Always make sure to back up the Registry or create a System Restore Point before making any changes.
