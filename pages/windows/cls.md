The command 'cls' in computing refers to the 'clear screen' command. It is used in command-line interfaces or console windows to clear the contents of the terminal screen. When executed, it clears the display screen and moves the cursor to the top of the screen.

The 'cls' command works on both Windows Command Prompt and Linux/Unix shell. It is a simple and effective way to declutter the command prompt screen, especially when there's too much information displayed on the screen.

'cls' command frees up the command prompt screen, it's also useful when you want to keep your commands and outputs separate, allowing you to easily read and follow the command line. This command does not delete any data, and the output is not saved to disk for future use. Once you execute the 'cls' command, you cannot undo the operation, and the previous screen output is permanently cleared from the screen.
