The command "sfc" stands for System File Checker. It is a Windows command-line utility used to verify and repair system files in the Windows operating system. 

When you run the sfc command, it performs a system scan and checks for any corrupt or missing system files in the Windows operating system. If any files are found to be missing or corrupted, SFC replaces them with cached copies stored in the Windows operating system, in order to fix the problem.

The syntax of the basic command is:

sfc /SCANNOW

This command scans the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with the correct Microsoft versions. 

Additionally, the sfc command supports various modifiers, which can be used to customize the process:

- /VERIFYONLY: Checks for file corruption without repairing them;
- /SCANFILE: Scans the specified file;
- /VERIFYFILE: Verifies the specified file;
- /SCANONCE: Scans the system and allows Windows to self-heal;
- /CACHEONLY: Scans and verifies but will only use cached files.

Overall, sfc is a useful tool to diagnose and repair system errors on Microsoft Windows operating systems.
