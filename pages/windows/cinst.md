"cinst" is not a valid command for typical operating systems like Windows or Mac. It may be specific to certain software or programs.

If you are referring to the chocolatey package manager for Windows, then "cinst" is a shorthand command for the "choco install" command. It is used to install packages or applications from the chocolatey repository onto a Windows machine.

The command syntax for using "cinst" is:

```
cinst <package_name>
```

For example, to install Google Chrome using chocolatey, you would run the command:

```
cinst googlechrome
```

This will automatically download and install the latest version of Google Chrome on your Windows machine.

Note that in order to use "cinst" or chocolatey on your machine, you must first install chocolatey by following their installation guide.
