The "clip" command in Windows is used to copy the contents of the standard input (such as text entered via the keyboard) to the clipboard. This allows users to easily copy and paste information between different applications.

Here's how the "clip" command works:

1. Open the Command Prompt by typing "cmd" in the Run dialog box (Win + R) and click OK.

2. Type the command you want to copy to the clipboard. For example, if you want to copy the contents of a file named "sample.txt" to the clipboard, enter the following command: type sample.txt | clip

3. Press Enter to execute the command. The contents of the file will be copied to the clipboard.

4. Open any application where you want to paste the copied text and press Ctrl + V (or right-click and select Paste) to paste the text.

Overall, the "clip" command is a simple but powerful tool that can save you a lot of time and effort when it comes to copying and pasting information between applications.
