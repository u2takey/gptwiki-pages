As an AI language model, I do not have access to a specific operating system or software to provide comprehensive details about the "bugreportz" command. However, I can provide general information about how bug reports work.

Bug reports are documents that detail issues or errors encountered while using software or a computer system. These reports typically include detailed descriptions of the problem, steps to reproduce the issue, screenshots, logs, and other relevant information that can help developers identify and fix the problem.

To generate a bug report, you must first identify the software or system that is experiencing issues. Many software programs have built-in bug reporting tools that can be used to generate reports automatically. For example, a web browser may prompt you to send a report when it crashes or encounters a problem.

If the software does not have a built-in tool, you can typically generate a bug report by capturing a system log or using a third-party bug reporting tool. 

Again, as an AI language model, I do not have access to specific details on the 'bugreportz' command, and I suggest referring to the relevant documentation for further information.
